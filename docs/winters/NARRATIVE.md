# Winter Narratives

To-do: Add the correct flavor text and setup info for year one of six winters. Discuss first three available missions: Eastkeep, North Oaks, and Sunriders. Add clues to help players make initial choice.

Maybe have some choices for Red Bank that help configure different starting setup? Like various alliance tracks or society tracks.

For example, you can have a martial society and get X or a diplomatic society and get Y. Etc. Having some customizability early will help with player investment.

NOTE: The number of threats in the threat deck during each winter can be used to determine how bad things are. For example, if there are two or less threats, it's okay. If there are 3-4, -1 on a resource track, etc. That would punish the players for ignoring threats.

There might be opportunities to do similar things for the apotheosis track and secrets track. If it's at X, look at page Y and then more stuff happens, etc.To-do: Add the correct flavor text and info for year two of six winters. Discuss first next available missions. Add clues to help players make initial choice.

# Thematic Ideas

Buildings were erected in the huge cities of Babylon, Persepolis, Pasargadae and Susa, where King Darius built a magnificent palace using the highest-quality ebony and silver from Egypt and cedar from Lebanon, fine gold from Bactria, lapis and cinnabar from Sogdiana, turquoise from Khwarezm and ivory from India.

The most famous and valuable mounts were bred in the Fergana valley to the far side of the spectacular Pamir mountain range that straddles what is now eastern Tajikstan and north-eastern Afghanistan. Much admired for their strength, they are described by Chinese writers as being sired by dragons and are referred to as hanxue ma or sweating blood - the result of their distinctive red perspiration that was caused either by a local parasite or by the horses' having unusually think skin and therefore being prone to blood vessels bursting during exertion.

Diplomatic envoys typically accompanied large caravans bringing goods for trading, which then returned home with products that were sought after at home - including Red Sea pearls, jade, lapis lazuli and consumables such as onions, cucumbers, coriander, pomegranates, pistachios and apricots. Highly desirable frankincense and myrrh, which in fact came from Yemen and Ethiopia, were known in China as Possu - that is, Persian goods. As we know from one later source, the peaches of Samarkand were considered immensely valuable: 'as large as goose eggs' and with a famously rich color to them, they were known in China as Golden Peaches.
