To-do: Add the correct flavor text and setup info for year one of six winters. Discuss first three available missions: Eastkeep, North Oaks, and Sunriders. Add clues to help players make initial choice.

Maybe have some choices for Red Bank that help configure different starting setup? Like various alliance tracks or society tracks.

For example, you can have a martial society and get X or a diplomatic society and get Y. Etc. Having some customizability early will help with player investment.
