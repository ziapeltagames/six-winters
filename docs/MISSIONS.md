# Missions Variant

The missions variant uses mission cards instead of the normal win/lose conditions at the end of the campaign. These mission cards have narrative text on them, goals for the sessions, and separate effects for win and loss conditions.

# Mission Cards

Mission cards have the following information:

* Title
* Years available - The years the mission card may be selected
* Setup - Information regarding setup conditions
* Goals - What to do during the session in order to succeed
* Success results - On the back of the card, follow these steps if successful (in green)
* Fail results - On the back of the card, follow these steps if unsuccessful (in red)

The red star on the front of the mission cards indicates the **difficult** setting. Choose beforehand whether to play the campaign on standard (neither mission card is difficult), difficult (one mission card is difficult), or very difficult (both mission cards are difficult).

If a mission card is difficult, there are usually additional setup steps and goals.

## Goals

The core part of each mission card are the goals. These tend to come in two varieties: certain resource symbols, indicating progress cards that must be finished by the end of the game, and/or certain obstalces that must be overcome by the end of the game.

Most goals focus on resource symbols. For instance, a goal could have two Support symbols, which means the players collectively must finish two support progress cards by the end of the game.

If the two mission cards selected have the same symbols, they are **added** together to determine totals. For instance, if one mission card has 2 Stability and 1 Espionage, and the other has 2 Technology and 1 Espionage, the players must complete 2 Stability, 2 Espionage, and 2 Technology by the end of the mission.

Some mission cards have a "complete XYZ progress cards, then place and overcome ABC obstacles" format. This means the obstacles are not placed until certain progress cards are completed.

## Campaign Effects

One of the new things mission cards introduce (replacing resource mastery bonuses), are **Campaign Effects**. These are effects written in bold on the back of mission cards. They stay in play until indicated, or until replaced by another effect with the same name.

For instance, there could be a DIPLOMACY effect that gives better trades, and stays in play until a different DIPLOMACY effect is unlocked. They're always the first result in success/fail sections so that you can lay them on top of each other during play, showing only the active campaign effects.

# Rules Changes

## Campaign Setup

The campaign setup in either case is the same.

## Session Setup

Session setup is a little different, as follows:

1. Restore Locations and Obstacles - Unchanged
2. Build Progress Deck - Unchanged
3. **Choose Missions** - This is new. At the start of each session choose **two** missions from the available mission cards for the year. Each mission card has the years it is available at the top.
4. **Follow Mission Setup** - Mission cards typically indicate certain obstacles that need to be put into play. Search through the locked obstacle cards first, then search the standard obstacle decks. Sometimes missions indicate putting certain locations into play
5. Draw Starting Progress Cards - Unchanged
6. Create Progress Staging Area - Unchanged
7. Choose Characters - Unchanged
8. Set Tracks and Fill Starting Dice Pools - Unchanged
9. Place Characters at Locations - Unchanged
10. Place Season Time Marker - Unchanged

## Turns

The core gameplay is mostly unchanged, with the following exceptions:

* Achievements - characters no longer gain achievements for overcoming a certain type of obstacle. Instead, characters gain one achievement at the end of a session, and mission cards give out other achievements
* Resource Mastery - players no longer get bonuses (aside from more dice) for raising up progress tracks. Instead, mission cards create **Campaign Effects** that change the rules of the game (both for Success and Fail results)
* Threat Tracks - increasing threat tracks no longer adds obstacles to decks. Mission cards add and remove obstacles from the decks. Also! You no longer add special threat locations if the threat tracks reach the final space. Threat tracks still factor into endgame scoring, and they can make the final missions more difficult
* Lowering Threats - in this version, if a progress track is at the last space, and it increases, **instead** lower the related threat marker by the same amount
* Lowering Progress - similarly, if a threat track marker reaches the end, and increases, instead lower the related progress by the same amount

## Session End

The big changes are during session end. Location cards aren't removed based on number of obstacles.

1. Clear Unfinished Progress and Assets - Unchanged
2. Burn Progress Cards - Unchanged
3. **Clear Lower Difficulty Obstacles** - Look at the threat icons for each obstacle, and discard any that are below the related progress level to their region's obstacle deck. For instance, if the obstacle has a military threat icon and a difficulty of 1, and the players military progress level is 2, it is discarded. For obstacles with multiple threat icons, use the icon with the lowest progress (the one most unfavorable for players)
3. **Resolve Missions** - For each mission card, determine if the players completed the goals (sometimes the players will have to choose one or the other mission card to complete if they don't have the progress needed for both). Then follow the Success/Fail instructions on the back, which could involve adding locations and obstacles to the game, creating campaign effects, or modifying characters in various ways
3. Reconstruct Obstacle Decks - Shuffle the discard piles into the obstacle decks
4. Recover Conditions - Unchanged
5. **Achievements** - Each character that was used for this session gains one achievement, in addition to any conferred by mission cards
6. **Advance Year** - Unchanged
7. **Store Game** - Unchanged

## Campaign End

The campaign ends by completing Year 6 mission cards. The players must take the military mission card (Veteran Alone), and may choose from one of the other three.

Scoring works the same: you get points for each progress track that's higher than the related threat track.
