This document illustrates the different types of benefits players can gain in _Six Winters_, along with how those benefits map to encounters, personality, developments, locations, mission paths, and artifacts.

# Broad Types of Advantages

This list of advantages is sorted *roughly* in order of benefit, with the best advantages at the end of the list. Gaining fortune is a very common benefit. Fortune fuels other abilities, particularly personality and developments, and is one of the core economies of the game.

Advantages that are more transient, such as bonuses to a certain kind of test, are naturally not as useful as permanent changes, such as improving a character's skill. Some advantages, such as lowering apotheosis or removing discord, should be very rare, since those are both key timers that help push the game forward and help to build tension. In fact, increasing discord or apotheosis as a play cost for an advantage can create some tough choices for players.

* Draw Threat Card(s)
* Search for Threat

## Test and Task Manipulation

Tests and tasks are the two primary ways players interface with the game. It is natural that many of the benefits will apply to these two core mechanics.

There are many ways to make skill tests easier. Certain dice rolls may count as extra successes, for example each '6' could count as two successes. Or '4' could count as a success, instead of the normal '5' and '6'.

The duration of effects also impacts their usefulness. For example, a card may give a one time bonus to a test. The is not as usefully as something that stays in play for the whole season. Finally, the most useful would be a spotlight location or artifact which can be played at the start of a mission.

## Using Tags

One way to make advantages less useful is by restricting their use to the presence of certain tags. For example, a development might give a bonus to defense for any obstacle with an Undead tag. Using tags provides a way to inject more theme into the game, and it gives players interesting choices, since some characters may be better suited to different sorts of situations. The TAGS.md document gives more info on common tags that can be used with cards.

## Play Costs

Another way to make advantages less useful is to use play costs. For example, a card may cost a certain number of resources (either number of dice or value of dice) to put into play, or the players may have to take Discord or a condition. This is a very useful pattern for the game. Play costs help move the economies of the game around.

## Removing Conditions and Discord

These abilities should be used with care. Taking Conditions and getting Discord are a big source of tension, so it shouldn't be easy to lower them. It's better to have abilities that help lower the hindrance value of obstacles or that improve defense. Once you get Discord or Conditions, they should be hard to remove. In the case of discord, that usually invovles spending some other resource or getting a condition.

# Advantages and Card Types

This section provides design guidance on how frequently these different sorts of advantages are found on the various types of cards. It's okay if there is overlap. For example, many different types of cards may provide extra Fortune or give bonuses to tasks and tests. However, it is also nice if they are differentiated enough that they feel different.

## Encounter Cards

Fortune is the main advantage found on Encounter cards. The other sorts of advantages are more dependent on what type of mission the players are on.

* Fortune
* Resource Dice
   * Mainly during Exploration missions
* Threat Progress
   * Mainly during Alliance missions
* Secrets
   * Mainly during Infiltration missions

## Personality Cards

On some personality cards, there is a burn option. Typically the option to burn the card advances a relaionship between characters and may be trickier to make happen. Burning personality cards provides an advantage to the player, because their asset deck can shrink in size and they can employ more deck building concepts using developments.

The biggest focus of personality cards is interactions between characters. As such, most of them should have requirements that character X or Y are present.

* Better Defense
* Extra Movement
* Moving Obstacles
* Moving Threats
* Progress
* Burning Threats
* Secrets
* Lower Discord
* Lowering Apotheosis

The discard options for personality cards should mainly revolve around adding more progress, rerolling dice for tests. The burn options can be more creative - and they can more frequently leverage secrets to do powerful things, like lowering the apotheosis pool.

They probably shouldn't give permanent +1s to skills, since that ties a skill to a character, which would somewhat limit flexibility. The +1 skill sorts of cards are developments.

## Developments

Developments are also differentiated somewhat by type. Maybe as a general rule none of these should remove conditions or discord? That might be a better thing for character cards to do. The various types should also roughly map to the different quest types.

It would also be good if the peak development in each track was fairly powerful. It probably needs to be something valuable in the climactic mission? Since it will be purchased so late in the campaign?

## Artifacts

These should be very good, at the level of the best developments or the highest lifepath cards. One big advantage with artifacts is that they start the session in play.
