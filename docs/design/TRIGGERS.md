# Core Triggers

The usual deck size for a mission is twenty cards, which is where these numbers come from. The core triggers are fairly critical for mission prorgress. At least one of these core triggers needs to be on each encounter card.

## Timers

Timers play the most important role in the encounter deck. They determine how long a mission will last. If there are fewer timers, the mission will last longer. There need to be at least three timers for each step of the mission path.

The standard encounter deck is twenty cards, ten of which are timers. This produces a game that usually lasts between 12 and 21 turns, with the most common game being around 14.

Timers / Deck Size: Avg Number Turns (Low Risk) - Avg Number Turns (High Risk)

10/20: 12 - 21
11/20: 11 - 18
12/20: 10 - 16

10/21: 13 - 22
11/21: 12 - 19
12/21: 11 - 17

10/22: 14 - 24
11/22: 12 - 21
12/22: 11 - 18

## Progress and Discord

In general, progress triggers are favored over discord triggers. Something like 5 progress and 3 discord is a good baseline. See the analysis below under timer cards for what this means in terms of totals.

If discord is much higher, it will incentivize players to knock out obstacles. Lowering the number of discord triggers will make it such that players may push their luck more.

## Threat and Apotheosis

These should be more rare, although it's certainly possible to have a mission that features these more, but it would be brutal. By default, each of these should probably occur only once.

# Supplemental Triggers

All of the following triggers must be used at least once in an encounter deck: Eldritch, Trap, Doom, Forceful, Quick, Deadly.

## Frequencies

It can be difficult to understand how often triggers will be drawn. It depends on deck size and on how aggressive a player is with pushing their luck. Of course, the triggers placed one cards with timers will usually only occur once, since timer cards are not shuffled back into the encounter deck. This fact can be leveraged when deciding how to interact various triggers with obstacles. For example, one really bad trigger could be placed on a timer card, and it will only interact with an obstacle once.

## Non-timer Card Analysis

It's easier to do the math on the non-timer cards. In that case, it roughly breaks down as follows, where the ranges are the number of times the trigger is drawn. The lower end is for a player moving quickly (moving to the next stage when two timers are drawn) and the higer end for a player waiting until three timers are drawn. All of this analysis is done on the standard 20 card deck with 10 timers.

1: 0.69 - 1.24
2: 1.37 - 2.51
3: 2.05 - 3.73 
4: 2.76 - 5.01
5: 3.44 - 6.22
6: 4.12 - 7.46
7: 4.84 - 8.72
8: 5.49 - 9.92
9: 6.19 - 11.25
10: 6.89 - 12.44

Note that for non-timer cards, triggers tend to occur more later in the mission, since more timer cards are removed as the mission progresses.

## Timer Card Analysis

For timer cards, triggers are naturally bounded, since timer cards are not reshuffled back into the deck. This not only gives them a hard maximum, but also tends to narrow the variance.

1: 0.59 - 0.90
2: 1.19 - 1.80
3: 1.79 - 2.70
4: 2.39 - 3.60
5: 2.98 - 4.50
6: 3.59 - 5.39
7: 4.20 - 6.29
8: 4.79 - 7.20
9: 5.39 - 8.09
10: 6.00 - 9.00

## Combined Triggers

It's also perfectly normal to put a particular trigger on both timer and non-timer cards. This would make the trigger occur at a more steady rate.
