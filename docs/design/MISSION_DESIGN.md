To-do: When the design stops changing so much, this will have mission design guidance that can be used to possibly hire other people to help make missions. Right now the game is in flux too much.

# General Mission Design Philosophy

Missions fall into a number of broad categories: exploration, alliance, infiltration, and quest. Each of these categories somewhat dictates a direction for how the mission should evolve. The difficulty of a mission, a number from 1-10, also provides some guidance to mission construction. Within those broad constraints is quite a bit of latitude.

## Mission Overview

Most missions have an encounter deck which is randomly shuffled. Without that, there is a linear series of challenges.

## Locations

One of the first decisions is how many locations to place in a mission, and how long each should last.

## Encounters

It is not necessary to have an encounter deck, but random events add variety to the game and can be fun. They are typically triggered by the common or uncommon symbols on the progress card deck.

# Quest Design Brainstorming

The older quests had a few locations, which were effectively serial challenges, folowed by a number of challenges. Should locations go away sometimes? Or maybe sometimes you can freely move to a new location?
