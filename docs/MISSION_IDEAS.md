# General Mission Brainstorming

The following types of cards may be found during a mission.

* Hand - Place into player's hand.
   * Artifact - Place in hand. Additionally, a player may start any season with this card in their hand.
* Foe - Goes into the area for foes.
   * Maybe need a better word for this? In an alliance mission, they aren't really foes. Maybe opponent? Rival? Opposition?
* Event - Handle immediately.
* Attachment - Attach to what's described, either a character or a location.
* Location - Place on the mission tableau. May also be added to the spotlight tableau.

## Multiple Players

It's possible for both players to go on the same quest. In general, this is overkill, but it is possible. This is also discouraged by having "lowest" skill tests. However, there may be times where it's useful to undertake the same mission. In particular, this is true for the Animaelic Forest quest.

# Infiltration

Infiltration missions are on average more difficult. They're the main method by which you get secrets, but they have the most downside.

Increase: Secrets, Apotheosis
Decrease: Society, Resources, Dispositions

How many locations? Maybe try having all the locations out initially, and then having a number of challenges on top of those? Maybe with a set of guards that are moving around.

# Quests

Quests are the most diverse, from the animaelic forest (which is how you win the game) to a minor side quest unlocked by a threat. There is tremendous latitude in how these are constructed as well as what sorts of rewards are gained. Many quests have interesting locations or artifacts.

## Gossamer Veil

The older quests had a few locations, which were effectively serial challenges, folowed by a number of challenges. Should locations go away sometimes? Or maybe sometimes you can freely move to a new location?
