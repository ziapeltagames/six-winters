Musings about design ideas central to _Six Winters_.

* [Currencies](#currencies) - Economies central to the game. 
* [Card Types](#card-types) - Various types of cards in the game.
* [Card Effects](#card-effects) - Broad ideas for card efffects based on card types.

# Currencies

These are all of the various currencies in the game. Ultimately, _Six Winters_ is intentionally very episodic in nature. These currencies are roughly ordered from longer term to shorter term.

* Seasons - The march of seasons restricts mission choices
* Missions - Players are not able to undertake every mission, and must make choices based on long term strategy
* Threats - Each year there is a set of different threats to deal with
* Stability - Stability is an important long term currency, since it restricts how many developments can be used
* Spotlight Locations - These can be unlocked with different missions
* Resource Tracks - Higher resource tracks make it easier to gain more of that type of resoruce
   * Timber
   * Mana
   * Ore
   * Luxury
   * Food
* Developments - A way to improve asset decks long term
   * Sorcery
   * Military
   * Diplomacy
   * Technology
   * Espionage
* Character Skills
* Character Tags - Usually relate to special unlocked character cards
* Motivation Cards
* Discord Cards
* Resource Dice - Resource dice fuel asset and location abilities
   * Timber
   * Mana
   * Ore
   * Luxury
   * Food
* Conditions
* Discord Pool
* Progress - The main activity players are trying to do is gain various types of progress to achieve their goals
   * Threat Progress - Not as essential, but dealing with threats is helpful for the showdown
   * Obstacle Progress - Obstacles are the main thing players deal with in the short term
   * Mission Progress - A central part of the game, tend to fluctuate greatly

## Sources of Uncertainty

Games are a combination of choices and uncertainty. If either element is lacking, it's not very interesting. Identifying how choices and uncertainty mix is useful for figuring out where the game might be lacking. Also might be worth thinking about similar games and how they handle the same problems. Is it possible to think about using elements from similar games? These are the primary sources of uncertainty in _Six Winters_.

* Resource Dice - There are many resource dice, so this chance does tend to average out, but it can still drive choices
* Asset Deck - This is the biggest source of uncertainty, and manipulating the asset deck well is the main method for success
   * Triggers
   * Developments
   * Motivation Cards
   * Discord Cards
* Encounter Cards

# Card Types

There are five different types of cards in the game. Each type of card has slightly different ways it is put into play and used.

* Asset - Typically these are held in a player's hand, they can usually be played as interrupts whenever the player wants
   * Sometimes there are restrictions on how they can be played, for example, only on a character at a wilderness location, etc
   * Some assets are played down as a global effect for the remainder of the game
* Location - These are places that characters can be, they typically have actions on them that characters can do
   * Spotlight locations are places the player's have found that they put into play at the start of a mission
* Attachment - Cards that attach to a location or a character and affect it somehow
* Event - These cards do something and then are usually discarded
* Obstacle - These cards attach to locations and have codified rules for burning them

## Tags

Tags might appear on cards to give them more flavor and pair with character abilities. Tags are mostly for obstacles and locations.

Common tags: Wilderness, Urban, Dungeon, Red Bank, Diplomat, Foe, Guard, Trap

## Card Decks

Finally, the different types of cards get placed into different decks depending on how they're used.

* Asset - Each player uses an asset deck that has triggers for locations and obstacles along with effect cards
* Developments - These cards are available for purchase during the game, later they are placed in the progress deck at the start of the mission
* Encounter - The encounter deck for the mission has random events characters encounter via progress deck triggers
* Achievement - Used to restrict the number of achievements in play

# Card Effects

Following is a list of advantages and disadvantages cards may confer, sorted *roughly* in order of impact, with the most impactful card effects at the end of the list.

Effects that are more transient, such as bonuses to a certain kind of test, are naturally not as useful as permanent changes, such as improving a character's skill. Some effects, such as removing discord, should be more rare, since those are both key timers that help push the game forward and help to build tension. In fact, increasing discord or apotheosis as a play cost for an advantage can create some tough choices for players.

* Add To / Subtract From Test
* Test Redraw
* Automatic Test Successes
* Bypass Obstacle Defenses
* Improved Obstacle Defenses
* Add To / Subtract From Progress on Locations or Obstacles
* Add / Remove Resource Dice - Removing resource dice should be fairly clearly telegraphed, not a good use for encounter events
* Resource Dice Rerolls
* Better Defense
* Extra Movement
* Trading Resources
* Moving Obstacles
* Draw Asset Card(s)
* Rearrange Encounter Deck
* Rearrange Asset Deck
* Moving Threats
* Cheaper Development Costs
* Adding Progress Remotely (Not At Location)
* Search for Encounter Card
* Search for Asset Card
* Improving Skills - Character skills should never go down, that's too demoralizing
* Add / Remove Conditions
* Add / Remove Threat Progress
* Extra Timer - This is pretty harsh
* Canceling Timers
* Add / Removing Discord - Discord should be fairly difficult to remove
* Resource Track Increase / Decrease
* Stability Track Increase / Decrease

There are other types of advantages which are very situational. Frequently, doing something like drawing threats isn't desired, but there are reasons it's useful.

* Draw Threat Card(s)
* Search for Threat

## Test Manipulation

Tests are the primary way players interface with the game. It is natural that many of the benefits will apply to this core mechanics. Redrawing is an option, but can start to be a little cumbersome. It also churns through the deck quicker. Improved character skills and new character cards are longer term methods to grow this ability. Attachments or global effects are another option here.

## Using Tags

One way to make advantages less useful is by restricting their use to the presence of certain tags. For example, a development might give a bonus to defense for any obstacle with an undead tag. Using tags provides a way to inject more theme into the game, and it gives players interesting choices, since some characters may be better suited to different sorts of situations.

## Play Costs

Another way to make advantages less useful is to use play costs. For example, a card may cost a certain number of resources (either number of dice or value of dice) to put into play, or the players may have to take discord or a condition. This is a very useful pattern for the game. Play costs help move the economies of the game around. This is common for assets.

## Removing Conditions and Discord

These abilities should be used with care. Taking Conditions and getting Discord are a big source of tension, so it shouldn't be easy to lower them. It's better to have abilities that help lower the hindrance value of obstacles or that improve defense. Once you get Discord or Conditions, they should be hard to remove. In the case of discord, that usually invovles spending some other resource or getting a condition.

## Event Card Effects

Events are short term challenges players face during a mission. They lean mostly negative in nature. The positive cards come more from the asset deck. Many feature a skill test to determine if the effect is positive or negative. Furthermore, certain mission types lean towards certain types of effects.

* Take Discord
* Take Condition
* Gain or Trade Resource Dice
   * Mainly during Exploration missions
* Add Threat Progress
   * Mainly during Alliance missions
* Secrets
   * Mainly during Infiltration missions

## Personality Cards

On some personality cards, there is a burn option. Typically the option to burn the card advances a relaionship between characters and may be trickier to make happen. Burning personality cards provides an advantage to the player, because their asset deck can shrink in size and they can employ more deck building concepts using developments.

The biggest focus of personality cards is interactions between characters. As such, most of them should have requirements that character X or Y are present.

* Better Defense
* Extra Movement
* Moving Obstacles
* Moving Threats
* Progress
* Burning Threats
* Secrets
* Lower Discord
* Lowering Apotheosis

The discard options for personality cards should mainly revolve around adding more progress, rerolling dice for tests. The burn options can be more creative - and they can more frequently leverage secrets to do powerful things, like lowering the apotheosis pool.

They probably shouldn't give permanent +1s to skills, since that ties a skill to a character, which would somewhat limit flexibility. The +1 skill sorts of cards are developments.

## Developments

Developments are also differentiated somewhat by type. Maybe as a general rule none of these should remove conditions or discord? That might be a better thing for character cards to do. The various types should also roughly map to the different quest types.

It would also be good if the peak development in each track was fairly powerful. It probably needs to be something valuable in the climactic mission? Since it will be purchased so late in the campaign?

   * Core Advantages
      * Survival (+1, +2)
      * Timber (+1, +2)
      * Food (+1, +2)

      * Command (+1, +2)
* Espionage (All Resources)
   * Advantages
      * Disguise
      * Thievery
      * Infiltration

## Locations

These should be permanent manipulations.

* Raising Tracks

Should be roughly ten of these that can be found, for all of the tracks.

* More Resources
* Using Disposition
* Drawing Threats

### Spotlight Locations

* Emphasizing Alliances

## Artifacts

These should be very good, at the level of the best developments or the highest lifepath cards. One big advantage with artifacts is that they start the session in play.To-do: When the design stops changing so much, this will have mission design guidance that can be used to possibly hire other people to help make missions. Right now the game is in flux too much.

# Characters

Each character in the campaign has personality cards which make them better suited to various types of missions.

## Thea (Starting Character)

* Alliance 4, Exploration 2
* Costs
   * Fortune

## Menas (Starting Character)

* Exploration 4, Alliance 2
* Costs
   * Food

## Fuscus (Starting Character)

* Alliance 3, Infiltration 3
* Costs
   * Luxury
   * Secrets

## Keel (Starting Character)

* Infiltration 4, Exploration 2
* Friendly: Menas, Thea, and Lucia.
* Dislikes: Oniri
   * Disagreement between tech and magic.
* Costs
   * Ore
   * Secrets

## Oniri (North Oaks)

* Infiltration 4, Exploration 2
* Shadow Walk
* Costs
   * Mana

## Yasmini (Sunriders, Gravewood, Burgan Vale)

## Viator (Sunriders, Gravewood, Crescent Hold, Lily Manor)

## Lucia (Eastkeep, Guilder Farms, Yearly Field, Dawncaves)This document illustrates the different types of benefits players can gain in _Six Winters_, along with how those benefits map to encounters, personality, developments, locations, mission paths, and artifacts.

# General Mission Design Philosophy

Missions fall into a number of broad categories: exploration, alliance, infiltration, and quest. Each of these categories somewhat dictates a direction for how the mission should evolve. The difficulty of a mission, a number from 1-10, also provides some guidance to mission construction. Within those broad constraints is quite a bit of latitude.

## Mission Overview

Most missions have an encounter deck which is randomly shuffled. Without that, there is a linear series of challenges.

## Locations

One of the first decisions is how many locations to place in a mission, and how long each should last.

## Encounters

It is not necessary to have an encounter deck, but random events add variety to the game and can be fun. They are typically triggered by the common or uncommon symbols on the progress card deck.

## Attachments

## Events

* The main text block can have up to 75 words in two paragraphs.

## Obstacles

* 

## Skill Tests

## Reward Cycles

# Quest Design Brainstorming

The older quests had a few locations, which were effectively serial challenges, folowed by a number of challenges. Should locations go away sometimes? Or maybe sometimes you can freely move to a new location?

Gossamer Veil Mission Deck: Memory Lake, Sailing Across, Isle of Apples, Stone Door, Vault of Echoes, Vault of Ten Locks, The Weaver

Gossamer Veil Encounter Deck: Forgotten Identity, Hollow Guards, Sunrider Icon (Delivery), Yari's Secret, Silk Trap, Arcane Research# Core Triggers

The usual deck size for a mission is twenty cards, which is where these numbers come from. The core triggers are fairly critical for mission prorgress. At least one of these core triggers needs to be on each encounter card.

## Timers

Timers play the most important role in the encounter deck. They determine how long a mission will last. If there are fewer timers, the mission will last longer. There need to be at least three timers for each step of the mission path.

The standard encounter deck is twenty cards, ten of which are timers. This produces a game that usually lasts between 12 and 21 turns, with the most common game being around 14.

Timers / Deck Size: Avg Number Turns (Low Risk) - Avg Number Turns (High Risk)

10/20: 12 - 21
11/20: 11 - 18
12/20: 10 - 16

10/21: 13 - 22
11/21: 12 - 19
12/21: 11 - 17

10/22: 14 - 24
11/22: 12 - 21
12/22: 11 - 18

## Progress and Discord

In general, progress triggers are favored over discord triggers. Something like 5 progress and 3 discord is a good baseline. See the analysis below under timer cards for what this means in terms of totals.

If discord is much higher, it will incentivize players to knock out obstacles. Lowering the number of discord triggers will make it such that players may push their luck more.

## Threat and Apotheosis

These should be more rare, although it's certainly possible to have a mission that features these more, but it would be brutal. By default, each of these should probably occur only once.

# Supplemental Triggers

All of the following triggers must be used at least once in an encounter deck: Eldritch, Trap, Doom, Forceful, Quick, Deadly.

## Frequencies

It can be difficult to understand how often triggers will be drawn. It depends on deck size and on how aggressive a player is with pushing their luck. Of course, the triggers placed one cards with timers will usually only occur once, since timer cards are not shuffled back into the encounter deck. This fact can be leveraged when deciding how to interact various triggers with obstacles. For example, one really bad trigger could be placed on a timer card, and it will only interact with an obstacle once.

## Non-timer Card Analysis

It's easier to do the math on the non-timer cards. In that case, it roughly breaks down as follows, where the ranges are the number of times the trigger is drawn. The lower end is for a player moving quickly (moving to the next stage when two timers are drawn) and the higer end for a player waiting until three timers are drawn. All of this analysis is done on the standard 20 card deck with 10 timers.

1: 0.69 - 1.24
2: 1.37 - 2.51
3: 2.05 - 3.73 
4: 2.76 - 5.01
5: 3.44 - 6.22
6: 4.12 - 7.46
7: 4.84 - 8.72
8: 5.49 - 9.92
9: 6.19 - 11.25
10: 6.89 - 12.44

Note that for non-timer cards, triggers tend to occur more later in the mission, since more timer cards are removed as the mission progresses.

## Timer Card Analysis

For timer cards, triggers are naturally bounded, since timer cards are not reshuffled back into the deck. This not only gives them a hard maximum, but also tends to narrow the variance.

1: 0.59 - 0.90
2: 1.19 - 1.80
3: 1.79 - 2.70
4: 2.39 - 3.60
5: 2.98 - 4.50
6: 3.59 - 5.39
7: 4.20 - 6.29
8: 4.79 - 7.20
9: 5.39 - 8.09
10: 6.00 - 9.00

## Combined Triggers

It's also perfectly normal to put a particular trigger on both timer and non-timer cards. This would make the trigger occur at a more steady rate.

# Sample Decks

## Basic Twenty Card Encounter Deck

Here's a standard twenty card deck, with ten timers, that works pretty well for a three stage mission path.

xxPROGRESS, xxQUICK
xxTHREAT, xxTRAP

There are number of types of achievements that could be put into play.

* Spending Resources
* Buy Developments
* No Obstacles of Type / Name X in Play
* Defeat an Obstacle - These
* Buy a Development
* Fulfill a Condition

### Brainstorm

Not sure if buying something that has an effect should count as "spending resources"? Probably not. This is spending resources solely in fulfillment of the achievement.

Achievements that are for taking out a specific obstacle are tricky. If the obstacle is in play at the start of the mission, it undermines the nature of card based achievements, since the obstacle could be tackled without the achievement being in play. But only being able to remove the obstacle without the achievement in play doesn't seem good at all, either. Probably the best option is to have "locked" obstacles that come into play when the achievement card does. That preserves the trade off of deciding when to tackle the achievement.Brainstorming about how the final mission should play out.

# The Animaelic Forest

The Animaelic Forest is a psychic map of the Autarch's internal pain. It's a place where time doesn't exist in the normal fashion. The player's will go through what the Autarch has gone through, while also dealing with their own insecurities and petty hatreds, which are amplified there. It would be nice if the lifepath cards, discord cards, possibly traits (if they're used) all come into play. 

## Movement

Seems like you shouldn't be able to move between spotlight locations. Maybe you don't even use spotlight locations at all? You go in with developments and artifacts, and no longer juggle threats are anything of that nature.

Having one shared encounter deck and shared locations might be the easiest way to handle this. So, no threats, no spotlight locations, just the animaelic forest location and encounter deck.

On the other hand, players will be pruning spotlight locations and coming up with a strategy that leverages. Changing that at the end might really ruin any sort of momentum there. Thematically it might be weird, but gameplay is more important - should probably leave things unchanged as much as possible!

* Current decision: leave the spotlight locations alone, but let characters move freely between mission locations (everyone is on the same mission).

## Discord

Not sure if discord should work the same way re: overflow. Normally a character gets a discord card which is unlocked after the mission. However, this is most likely the last mission. Could immediately put the card in the deck, or could do something different. One option might be that a character is permanently killed when discord overflows. That might give it more of the feel of a finale. Learning towards that.

It would also be cool if the discord characters have comes into play somehow. Maybe some cards can come out representing their worst selves, and the difficulty of getting rid of it depends on a character's current discord?

## Threats

Drawing a threat should probably do something else. Maybe adding discord? Or - perhaps the year six threats reflect the Apotheosis the Autarch has gained, and really, really suck. Then, if apoth happens earlier, can just use year six threats for the remainder of the game.

# Obstacles

If movement is more fluid, how should obstacles be handled? If all of these are shared, it would effectively double the number of triggers. Maybe that's appropriate here? Obstacles are basically twice as difficult? In that case, there would be one shared staging area, and all the locations would effectively be shared as well. The downside is that obstacles trigger basically twice as much, but that might be fine for a finale.

# Locations

The locations might be more abstract, reflecting emotions and feelings that the Autarch has.

## General Locations

* Despair
* Anger
* Safety
* Authority

# Mission Path

One longer mission path, like a quest, which both players work on together, might be more appropriate here? With lots of obstacles and bad locations coming into play that make this difficult.

## Autarch Trials

* Pass the Trial of Burning Copper in the Harrowing
* Defend against Guild of Security Bullies
* Stay still during the Ritual of Purity
* Defeat Or'thak, the beast of one thousand eyes
* Defend Arcus from Plainsman Raiders

It may culminate in a showdown with the shadow of the Autarch

## The Hive Memory

Implanting memories into the Autarch
Changing the past and future

# Apotheosis

It should be more difficult if the apotheosis has happened. One possibility is to use threats to make this more difficult. Perhaps these threats can be broad, global effects that make success more difficult.

# Encounters

* Twisted dopplegangers
* Maybe feature cards that take advantage of discord, leading to some tough choices? Minor breakdowns might amplify and cause one character to lash out at another one

# Personal Demons

What could come up for players? Obstacles? Locations? Encounters?

Might be nice to have these things be a little more persistent, so locations or encounters. But what would be an example?

Could also just have encounter cards that do something based on a character's discord. For example, place more discord out, or make something more difficult, give a character a condition, etc.

## Location

The difficulty could be based on discord? While the theme is a more general darkness the character must confront. Oniri might be called back to the underworld. A location might not be right, though, because it isn't something that generally has a broad effect (although it probably could). Then you could burn progress equal to the character's discord.

## Obstacle

"Ghosts of the Past", Hindrance: 2, Lore Difficulty equal to Oniri's discord.

## Attachment

These could be attached to different characters. This might be a good approach. In this case, it might be possible to attach the card to a different character.

## Character Backgrounds

To make all of this work, it's important to really flesh out the backgrounds for the characters. This is going to partly be done through lifepath cards and maybe darkness cards?# Character Cards

Ideas for character cards, motivation, and discord.

# Motivation

Currently, there are motivation cards for each character. Do they need to be more general? If a card is for character X and they aren't on the mission, what happens? Could discard it, which is probably the easiest approach. Or it could be burned.

Maybe some motivation cards could be general, such that any character could tackle them? Then again, that brings up weird things where a team of characters could make progress on it. And they're supposed to be solo sorts of efforts. One way around that is to attach them to a character.

## Ideas

Notes on culture and trade from ~1200s central Asia.

"Spectacular buildings were erected in the huge cities of Babylon, Persepolis, Pasargadae and Susa, where King Darius built a magnificent palace using the highest-quality ebony and silver from Egypt and cedar from Lebanon, fine gold from Bactria, lapis and cinnabar from Sogdiana, turquoise from Khwarezm and ivory from India."

"The most famous and valuable mounts were bred in the Fergana valley to the far side of the spectacular Pamir mountain range that straddles what is now eastern Tajikstan and north-eastern Afghanistan. Much admired for their strength, they are described by Chinese writers as being sired by dragons and are referred to as hanxue ma or 'sweating blood' - the result of their distinctive red perspiration that was caused either by a local parasite or by the horses' having unusually think skin and therefore being prone to blood vessels bursting during exertion."

"Diplomatic envoys typically accompanied large caravans bringing goods for trading, which then returned home with products that were sought after at home - including Red Sea pearls, jade, lapis lazuli and consumables such as onions, cucumbers, coriander, pomegranates, pistachios and apricots. Highly desirable frankincense and myrrh, which in fact came from Yemen and Ethiopia, were known in China as Possu - that is, Persian goods. As we know from one later source, the peaches of Samarkand were considered immensely valuable: 'as large as goose eggs' and with a famously rich color to them, they were known in China as 'Golden Peaches'."# Asset Deck Construction

As it currently stands, there are quite a few situational cards which can get tied up in player's hands. One thought is to make the asset deck more like a regular deck building game - such that you start drawing again when it's cleared out. To make that work, cards must be either discarded or played frequently.

## One Card Limit

Having only one asset card at a time may allow for two things: it's easier to keep track of what your card does, and it forces you to either play it or discard it to churn faster. The cards could also be a little more complex.

Players could choose what developments to put in their decks, but taking the character cards would be mandatory. That also gives a bottom end to how much you could realistically cycle your deck. If each character has two cards that can't be burned, it would mean there's at minimum a four card cycle in place. So you would probably only see the same development at most three or so times. That allows for some deck building ideas, but probably prevents less fun corner cases like a deck size of one.

## New Personality Cards

Using this model, there would always need to be *some* advancement cards that can't be burned or churned through. That way the deck size is at some minimal level. The particular development abilities will also help.

When a new year comes along, then, it will probably be the case that you have to take all of the new advancement cards for the character. That wouldn't allow customization at that level, like in developments. That may be okay. If it's possible to burn some advancement cards, it may be more of a game to decide when and how to make that happen. You could burn some of those cards in order to shrink your deck and use developments more.

## Using Tags

Another option may be to use tags sometimes. Burning certain cards could give you a tag. Then, during the narrative phase, if you have various tags, you have to take certain character cards? Maybe they should be called personality cards?

That's fiddly, but maybe not overly so. It does also give the game quite a bit of depth. It will be a little tricky to make sure that the discord cards and personality cards don't overlap too much.

# Deck Building

Currently the game doesn't include fully fleshed out deck building. In a standard deckbuilding game, the deck is the engine, and it builds up over time, with more of some sort of currency being generated. The progress deck right now has a series of triggers and timers, which control both how long the game takes and what sort of events happen. It might be nice to split them all up. So there is only one trigger on each card, possibly with one timer as well.

Into this mix are added developments and character cards. However, there's really no downside to adding these cards. In fact, you would always add all of your developments. In a standard deckbuilding game, these developments would be what generates currency (whatever that is - resources or what have you). In a standard deckbuilder, you would burn some of the cards that aren't doing as much for you.

The problem with doing a standard deckbuilder with Six Winters is that you can't burn the cards with triggers or timers on them, because it would be super easy to throw the whole deck out of whack. The timers are critical for pacing missions.

## Questions

* Why would you voluntarily leave developments out of a deck, or burn other developments?

If developments are always good, and other cards are always bad, you probably would never leave out developments. The burn effects on developments may motivate you to burn them for something even better. But otherwise, you're going to leave them in. Typically, tuning your deck, either by leaving stuff out or burning things, occurs if you have low value cards, along with some high value cards. You'll either leave out the low value cards or burn them. In this case, the cards of low value are triggers and timers. And it's not really possible to burn them. You would always choose to burn timers, since those end the season.

If there were also triggers on developments, that would make you more likely to burn them. That said, you could seriously skew those probabilities if they could be burn or modified. It seems like, in general, if you have a deck of "bad stuff" as it were, you can't really modify that.

You could have two decks: one for the progress cards and one for developments. Then you would want to tune the development decks. However, it gets back to having lots of different decks, which isn't great. Encounter deck, developments deck, and progress deck (with character cards). The benefit is that you might think more about the actual deckbuilding elements of the cards. That said - if the progress deck is what drives pulling cards, there will always be an issue of having various numbers of "draw development" cards in the progress deck. They would have to continually be added.

However, it could be the case that by simply paying for the various developments and having interesting burn options, there may be enough there to make for interesting choices.

## Option: Development Deck, Progress Deck (+ Character Cards), Encounter Deck

In this case you could either draw one development each turn, or you could have a location card which features a "draw development" ability. That does tie up actions for quite some time, though. For maybe nothing that interesting. # General Mission Brainstorming

The following types of cards may be found during a mission.

* Hand - Place into player's hand.
   * Artifact - Place in hand. Additionally, a player may start any season with this card in their hand.
   * Development - Frequently goes into a player's hand.
* Obstacle - Goes into the area for obstacles.
   * Maybe need a better word for this? In an alliance mission, they aren't really foes. Maybe opponent? Rival? Opposition?
* Event - Handle immediately.
* Attachment - Attach to what's described, either a character or a location.
* Location - Place on the mission tableau. May also be added to the spotlight tableau.

## Multiple Players

It's possible for both players to go on the same quest. In general, this is overkill, but it is possible. This is also discouraged by having "lowest" skill tests. However, there may be times where it's useful to undertake the same mission. In particular, this is true for the Animaelic Forest quest.

# Infiltration

Infiltration missions are on average more difficult. They're the main method by which you get secrets, but they have the most downside.

# Quests

Quests are the most diverse, from the animaelic forest (which is how you win the game) to a minor side quest unlocked by a threat. There is tremendous latitude in how these are constructed as well as what sorts of rewards are gained. Many quests have interesting locations or artifacts.

## Gossamer Veil

The older quests had a few locations, which were effectively serial challenges, folowed by a number of challenges. Should locations go away sometimes? Or maybe sometimes you can freely move to a new location?

# 9/3/2018 - Obstacles stay at locations

As it stands now, the hindrance mechanics aren't really engaged at all. Even one hindrance is too much. So, obstacles are typically in the staging area, or they're at a location and a character is trying to take them out. So something should be reworked.

It may be the case that a staging area isn't really needed at all. Instead, obstacles just show up at locations and stay there (barring some special character advancement card). Exploring these rules, obstacles would either show up at various mission locations in a pre-programmed way, or they would go to the current mission path location.

Some design goals:

* The total number of obstacles should matter. It's probably no good if you can just let obstacles go and not think about them.
* There should be reasons to take out obstacles, but also reasons to leave them alone.
* Obstacles should be able to impact a few economies: mainly discord and mission progress, but possibly other less common things like resources, apotheosis, or fortune.

There are probably plenty of ways to achieve this goal.

## Obstacles have a single danger or peril value, triggered by timer cards.

Fleshing this idea out, obstacles will just have one value, most likely in the range of 3-7.

### All discord applies

On the timer cards, there will be triggers for discord as well as mission progress. If discord triggers, you would add up all the danger on the obstacles that are currently in play, and take that much discord. If mission progress triggers, you would look at the current mission path location, and lose progress based on all the obstacles that are there.

The big problem with this variant is that discord losses would be very high, because there would be more obstacles not at mission path location than at mission path locations.

### Only at locations where characters are

This would lower the amount that triggers - but then there could be lots of obstacles in play that really aren't threatening characters, which goes against a key design goal.

### Discord is number of obstacles

This would lower the amount of discord, and may even scale pretty well. It would also mean the number of obstacles in play is a problem, although not a severe one in low numbers. If there are 1-5 obstacles out, that maps pretty well to a lower discord pool maximum, like 8 or so. Letting lots of them pile up wouldn't be great.

Then the peril could really be something which hinders progress, and only progress. If the value is lower, it would be frustrating, but not super irritating. Could also have a defend mechanic as well.

So, obstacles would have a trigger which lowers progress and can be defended against. Discord would also hit against the number of obstacles in play. Some obstacles may also have another trigger, which would apply to special effects. Might be able to just get away with one batch of triggers, though, since lots of obstacles wouldn't need dedicated triggers anymore.

## Obstacles have different values for discord and mission progress

This might work, but it's kind of fiddly, considering almost all of the obstacles would need a very low value for discord, nearer to one. At that point, may as well just count up the number of obstacles.# Character Cards

## Ideas

Thea: Card that reinforces she does better when focusing on one thing at a time? Oniri maybe has one that reflects handling multiple things at once?# Showdowns

Each chapter ends with a showdown. A showdown is a two pronged mission, intended to showcase stronger interactions between missions than are present during a regular session. Additionally, the achievements have **types** associated with them. The resolution of the showdown is based on how many of each type are collected during the session. There are three showdowns in the campaign. At the end of years two, four, and six.

## Interactions

Since both missions of the showdown are known, there is an oppotunity to have interactions between obstacles and cards from each mission. These are general patterns that might be used.

* Trade-off: In this pattern, an effect for mission A could be positive, while it could be negative for mission B. Removing the effect depends on the situation. This could also be done with a threat, where more progress helps mission A but hinders mission B.
* Conditional Chain: In this situation, an obstacle for mission A might need to be dealt with prior to the removal of an obstacle at mission B. This only becomes interesting if there is a different pressing situation at mission A that needs to be handled.
* Remote Action: Actions at mission A could have a more direct impact for mission B. Adding or removing progress, making tasks easier or harder.

### Brainstorm

It most likely will not be possible to lose a showdown in the traditional sense. Six Winters is far more of a narrative experience than an optimization experience. But the consequences for the showdown should be stronger than for a regular mission, and should involve Red Bank to a larger degree, rather than only focusing on characters.

# The First Showdown

The first showdown has two missions, **Tragedy and Conspiracy**, set in Red Bank, and **Whispers at Lily Manor**, set in Lily Manor, a major hub of trade.

An ill wind blows across the village of Outer Fernbrake, which sits on the northern edge of Red Bank. An insurgency of Imperial agents made a base there, in the old ruins of Sparrow Keep. They work to undermine Red Bank from within. In service to this goal, a mage, known as the Weaver of Secrets, has murdered Castor, a local boy. The sorcerous nature of the murder points the finger at Oniri, who is newly arrived in Red Bank. Agents of the Empire fan the flames of conspiracy theories that seek to bring down Oniri, and by association, Thea. The Autarch sees Oniri as a threat to her hegemony. And indeed, this task is succeeding. The people are turning against the leadership of Red Bank.

At the same time, envoys from Red Bank have arrived at Lily Manor for the annual Sunfall Trade. This is a major festival that draws in representatives from major factions throughout the lands of Six Winters. Despite the unrest in Red Bank, it would be folly to miss the opportunity to unite the factions in common cause against the Empire. But The Empire's influence is expanding at an alarming speed, taking both land and trade. The Empire also sent representatives to Lily Manor, working to undermine Red Bank's credibility.

## Interactions

The Empire has placed a veil ward to funnel malevolent energy into Red Bank. Conspiracies spread faster with a stronger Veil Ward. Weakening this ward also makes it easier to identify the Weaver of Secrets. If the Weaver of Secrets is brought down while the Subtect is in play, the Subtect becomes easier to take out. This is tricky to juggle, as both need to be in play at the same time.

Viator functions as somewhat of a wild card. Helping heal discord, but also making some issues more difficult. Zarrah is more difficult the more issues are in play. Finally, taking out the Sapphire Djinn can weaken the veil ward.

* Weaver of Secrets (LOCKED): Comes into play with the Weaver achievement. Weakened by weakening the veil ward. If taken out when the Subtect is in play, the Subtect can be weakened.

* Conspiracy Spreads: Fueled by the veil ward.
* Angry Locals: Fueled by conspiracies.

* The Subtect (LOCKED): Comes into play with the Subtect achievement. Can be weakened by stopping the Weaver.

* Zarrah (LOCKED): Comes into play with the Zarrah achievement.
* High Society (LOCKED): Comes into play with the Zarrah achievement.

* Global Stability: The difficulty of taking this out depends on how many conspiracies are in play in Red Bank.

* Sapphire Djinn: Can hurt the veil ward.
* Viator: A wildcard. Helps with discord - hurts with issues.

# Resolution

Based on the number of achievements of each type, a variety of results could happen. Possible negative results could include locations or effects that must be put into play, similar to spotlight locations. Or they could create more threats of a severe nature. That's nice, because it's already in the system. Additionally, could have tags placed onto Red Bank.

Positive results could grant access to new spotlight locations or special character cards.

## Diplomacy

A low diplomacy result makes it harder to trade or gain allies.

* 0: No factions are helpful
* 1: Lily Manor uncertain
* 2: Lily Manor helpful
* 3: Viator is motivated

## Stability

This will most likely impact the stability of Red Bank. Which has long lasting repercussions.

Brainstorming about different sorts of spotlight location abilities, and which mission they should appear in.

There should be one (or more) location abilities that raise each of the fifteen tracks in the game. Five resource tracks, five society tracks, and five faction disposition tracks. More than likely, the resource track increases should be found in exploration missions. The society tracks found in alliance missions. Society tracks can be sprinkled around elsewhere.

## Tracks

* Timber: North Oaks
* Food: Sightrock
* Ore:
* Mana: Dusk's Ayrie
* Luxury:

# Skills

* Locations with +1 skill for anyone at the location.
* Locations with +1 skill for all characters.Some of this doc should eventually be broken out into the rules sections. Right now it focuses on how the key systems interact as well as currency flows.

# Tests

Tests and other dice manipulations are a pretty big part of the game. Trying to strike a balance between using dice, but also having ways of controlling the uncertainty. Otherwise you can get some pretty big swings.

Following is a rough schema that describes how tests are organized.

* Required / Optional (default)
   * Not sure if required tests are a very good idea, probably not, but going to keep it as a possibility for now
   * Required tests might be useful on certain locations to make them less appealing
* Solo / Lowest / Red Bank / Group (default)
   * Solo means any character the player controls, or any character at the location, but only one can make the test per turn!
      * Solo should also probably be used sparingly
   * Lowest means the character with the lowest value of a skill
      * These are probably going to come in mainly from encounter cards
   * Red Bank tests use a red bank society track, so no mana may be used (no backlash)
      * Could also use alliance tracks for tests?
* Ongoing / One-time (default)
   * Ongoing will most likely have progress tracks on the card
   * In an ongoing test, the character just adds progress based on a skill or track

# The Progress Deck

The Progress Deck contains the following elements.

* Triggers (24)
   * Timers (6)
   * Draw Asset Card
* Shuffle Card (1)

The main purpose of the progress deck is to bring the mission to a close (timers), as well as trigger location and opponent abilities.

## Questions

* Do you need a timers broken out at all?
   * Or is it better to just put symbols on those cards and let the mission card decide what it all means?
   * For now, mixing the timers in seems better
* What's on the mission cards?
   * Symbols?
      * Seasons (winter, summer, spring, fall), Magic, Environment, Base Attack, Severe Attack, Timers
      * The advantage to symbols is that the whole thing could be decoupled
   * Instructions to draw from a deck (location or encounter)?

Another option might be a unified progress deck?

# Missions

A mission pack is split into three parts.

* Mission Overview Card
   * Mission Name
   * Mission Type
   * Difficulty
   * Relevant Skills
   * Flavor Text
   * Assets Available
   * Permanent Triggers
   * Timers
   * Achievements
   * Effects in Play
   * Art
* Mission Cards
   * The missions deck has cards in a specific ordering
   * They may be subdivided into a few different decks based on shorter goals
   * Some mission cards may are marked S for cards starting in play
      * Usually these are locations
* Encounters (usually 12 or so)
   * Types: Hand, Attachment, Event, Location, Artifact
   * Tags: Wilderness, Magic, Lair, Urban, Social, Dweomer, Foe, Guard, Obstacle, Environment, Asset, Resource, Secret, Favor
   * Triggers: "Completion", "On Entering Play", "Season End", "Return To Red Bank", "Lowest", "Solo", "Group"

## Questions

* How should the mission deck be structured?

* Can you fail missions?
  * No. (Current Choice)
     * It's not so fun to re-do a mission, particularly if you were close to finishing it the first time.
     * It's also more overhead to track progress.
     * Rather than fail, there would be "achievements" of some sort that would provide partial successes.

* Should a location be in play at all times?
   * Having one is probably easiest, so you can do "at this location" sort of effects. (Current Choice)
   * It also avoids confusing situations where a location goes away or appears and you have to shuffle characters around.
   * On the downside, it might be nice to have missions with no real fixed locations, or locations that evolve and grow.

* How do you get new mission cards?
   * Could progress through them via earlier mission cards. (Current Choice)
   * Could draw them based off of a symbol.
   * Could be part of a trigger from another card.
      * For example, an encounter card could unlock something from the mission deck.

* How do you get new encounters?
   * Could draw them based off of a symbol. (Current Choise)
   * Could be part of a trigger from another card.

# Threats

Two threats are drawn at the beginning of each season. They are typically an effect which is present through the whole season (unless resolved somehow) or an effect which triggers at season's end. The latter is the more common type of threat.

Threats tend to attach to a specific type of location, sometimes the threat will require the players to use a type of location if they have one. Sometimes a threat will take a location slot from those available.

## Arkham Card Game

The Arkham Card Game and Warhammer Quest Card Game are both similar to 6W in that they're linked narratives without a spatial map of any sort, relying more heavily on card play to account for interesting tactical choices.Tags are narrative keywords that appear on various cards. They provide hook to interact with card effects. All obstacles and locations in a mission should feature at least one tag.

Most encounter cards should have at least one tag as well, from any of the given categories.

# Common Tags

This is the current list of tags currently in use. New ones may be possibly added, but that should be done with care, as it will dilute the effectiveness of cards that use tags.

Many of these tags are more commonly found in certain sorts of missions. For example, Alliance missions are more likely to have cards witht he Diplomat and Diplomacy tags, as well as possible Urban locations, or maybe Stability.

* Wilderness
* Urban
* Dungeon
* Red Bank
* Imperial

* Guard
* Foe
* Undead
* Beast
* Diplomat
* Trap
* Environment

* Conquest
* Sorcery
* Stability
* Military
* Espionage
* Diplomacy
* Autarch

# Character Tags

This is a variant that is still under consideration. Characters may have tags that get added to them, and cards could refer to these tags. However, there is already quite a bit going on, so not sure if this is worth it or not!

The idea for these tags is that they could have benefits or penalties that are situational. Or perhaps they could combine in interesting ways.

* Headstrong
* Cautious
* Social
* Introverted
* Isolated
* Careful
* Bookish
* Studious
* Empathic
* Amiable
* Charming
* Protective# Threat Mechanics

Threats are played as:

* Locations (either to spotlight area or into the indicated mission area)
* Attachments to locations (must play the type of location if possible)
* Attachments to characters
* Obstacles (would need to go to one player's staging area, for general types of threats)

Threat effects are either:

* Effects that are ongoing
* Effects that occur when a certain progress trigger happens
* Effects that occur at the end of the season
     * This option doesn't generate as much pressure as the others

## Threat Triggers

As it stands now, triggers occur only on locations you're actually at. For obstacles, they occur broadly. They also occur on attachments attached to characters. Do they occur on all attachments generally?

Maybe they should just occur on all obstacles / attachments / locations? The "you have to be there" was to make it easier to scan over cards, but it makes threat design tough? Maybe all the locations / attachments / obstacles in the player's mission area as well as the spotlight area will activate.

## Threat Timers

One pattern that might be worthwhile is placing a certain amount of progress on a threat, that dwindles each time a trigger comes up. That's one used in Eldritch Horror frequently, and something like that may work here. The different development tracks could provide a good basis for that.

## Red Bank Tests

It would be nice if the threats weren't necessarily a guaranteed occurrence. One way that could happen is via a trigger causing a dice roll. These might be special sorts of tests where things like mana couldn't be used (since mana requires a caster and backlash). Something like, "Rare: Red Bank Test: Espionage 3. Success: Blah. Failure: Blah." Might be worth having that as a generally available test type?

On thinking about it more, this probably isn't necessary. The "not a guaranteed occurrence" can probably be handled by triggers. Although, the triggers are doubled, so need to take that into account.

# Threat Effects

* Lower resources
* Lower resource tracks
* Lower secrets
* Increase discord
* Increase apotheosis
* Give conditions
* Lower disposition
* Broad effects (no mana for spells, etc)

# Threat Ideas

* Military threats
   * Could "burn" Red Bank locations so that the location cards almost function as a hit points as such for badness
* Bandits
* Building a wonder to keep up with the Empire
   * Gardens of the Pomegranates
* Assassination
* Werewolf infection
* Pandemic
* Magical Backlash

This might provide another way to customize characters beyond lifepath and discord cards. These would be broad tags that could be assigned to characters, like headstrong or careful. They would show up on encounter cards and let characters make unique sorts of choices.

## Implementation Difficuties

Would need to come up with a list of traits beforehand. Probably in the 7-10 range? The best time to assign these might be during interludes. Putting them on encounter cards is probably the best spot for them. Putting them on locations could get pretty messy.

However, putting them on encounters makes them pretty random. Through the luck of the draw, you could certainly control none of the characters that have a particular trait. Not sure if there's a way around that? It's not ideal to have some cards that do nothing, though. Maybe they can do X thing, but if a character in the group has a trait, they do Y thing?

Will need to come up with a list of potential traits.

* Headstrong

?Why, but of course. Tonight is a night to be merry ? worries should be left at the door. A small little town like Redbank can cause no disturbance here.?


Viator?s sympathy

?Every city is of importance. Lily Manor will do everything in its power to aid Redbank. Any kingdom, large or small, is deserving of peace.?
