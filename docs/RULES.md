# Six Winters

This section is still very much unfinished. Currently, the procedures mostly live in the TURN_OVERVIEW.md file as well as in various brainstorming documents and in the designer's head.

# Overview

The players control Red Bank, a growing society that is under constant threat from the Empire of the Autarch. The Autarch is working to achieve an apotheosis, becoming powerful and unstoppable. The players are trying to thwart this apotheosis by discovering the secrets contained within the Animaelic Forest, the source of the Autarch's power, and her greatest weakness.

Six Winters is a mission based campaign game. Each session, players choose a mission to udertake, which is represented by different decks of cards. Players select characters for the mission from a common pool, taking into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of each character. A mission takes about an hour to play, and is played by one or two players.

There is a race between the Autarch gaining apotheosis and Red Bank learning secrets. If the Autarch gains apotheosis, it is possible for the players to win the campaign, although it becomes much more difficult.

* Hand - Cards that are held in a player's hand.
   * They are usually played as interrupts, whenever the player wants.
      * Occasionally they must be played during a specific phase, usually the refresh phase.   
   * Sometimes there are restrictions on how or when they can be played, for example, only on a character at a wilderness location, only by spending certain resources, only during the refresh phase, etc.
* Location - These are places that characters can be, they typically have actions on them that characters can do.
   * Spotlight locations are places the player's have found that they put into play at the start of a mission.
* Attachment - Cards that attach to a location or a character and affect it somehow.
   * Conditions, environments, challenges.
* Event - These cards do something immediately and then are usually discarded.

* Lifepath - Character lifepath cards are placed into the progress deck at the start of the mission.
* Discord - Character discord cards are placed into the progress deck at the start of the mission.

* Threats - Threat cards can come into play in the spotlight area during the mission
