# Six Winters

This section is still very much unfinished and in progress. Additionally, it is not always maintained with current content.

# Overview

**Six Winters** is a two player cooperative mission based campaign game. Each session, players choose missions to undertake, which are represented by different decks of cards. Players select characters for the mission from a growing character pool, taking into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of each character. A mission takes about ninety minutes to play. The design goal is to make a game for nerdy couples who enjoy a game with a strong narrative that can be played on a weeknight. 

The players control **Red Bank**, a growing society that is under constant threat from the **Empire of the Autarch**. The Autarch is working to achieve an **apotheosis**, becoming powerful and unstoppable. The players are trying to thwart this apotheosis by discovering the secrets contained within the **Animaelic Forest**, the source of the Autarch's power, but also her greatest weakness.

Along the way, seasons will pass, the characters will grow and change, and players will make choices about the strategic direction for Red Bank.

      * Occasionally they must be played during a specific phase, usually the refresh phase.   
   * Sometimes there are restrictions on how or when they can be played, for example, only on a character at a wilderness location, only by spending certain resources, only during the refresh phase, etc.
* Location - These are places that characters can be, they typically have actions on them that characters can do.
