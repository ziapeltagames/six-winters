# Six Winters v19.3

*Six Winters* is a cooperative fantasy campaign game for 1-4 players based on the *Wrath of the Autarch* tabletop role-playing game.

Players control **Red Bank**, a diasporic society under threat from the **Empire of the Autarch**. The Autarch is working to achieve a sorcerous apotheosis, rendering The Empire unstoppable and spelling certain doom for Red Bank. The players have six winters to stop this from happening. Each game of Six Winters is 2 to 3 hours long and plays out one year in the life of Red Bank.

During a session of the game, players select from a rotating cast of characters to make progress against the Empire. Each character has their own unique capabilities and limitations. Effectively managing these characters over the six winters is critical to successfully stopping the Empire!

`As this document is very much in progress, designer thoughts and notes are captured using this highlighted formatting. They help provide context and insights, but are not essential to understanding the game. For now, I'm capturing rules in markdown, which is not a very rich textual format, but is quick to edit, and ideal for the state the game is in. The number of helpful images and diagrams is going be minimal, because they are difficult and time consuming to create for a game that is in such a fluid state. In other words: it isn't going to be easy to understand the game from the given rules doc, but hopefully it's at least possible. More than anything, I'm interested in capturing a specific version of the rules to help weight playtesting decisions. The version number matches that used in Tabletop Simulator. Along with that, all of the graphic design and layout is only for prototype purposes and will certainly change at production time.`

## Resources

Characters leverage six **resources** to make progress against the Empire:

| Support | Technology | Espionage | Military | Diplomacy | Sorcery |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/capitol.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cowled.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stone-throne.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> |
 
Red Bank's **progress** in those areas is marked using a red cube on each associated twelve space **resource track**.

## Threats

**Threat levels** against Red Bank in each resource area are tracked using a gray cube on each resource track. If Red Bank's progress is higher than the associated threat marker, the players have **advantage** in that resource, which confers mechanical advantages during play. There are ways to slow the rate of threats and even lower threat levels during play.

`Lowering threat levels after they have advanced is much more difficult than trying to slow the rate of advancement in the first place. Completely stopping threat advancements requires some luck.`

## Victory

If the Red Bank progress marker is _alone_ on the last space of a resource track, that resource track is **complete**. After the sixth game, check for victory as follows:

* **Pyrrhic Victory**: Red Bank has completed one of Diplomacy, Support, or Espionage.
* **Major Victory**: Red Bank has completed any two of Diplomacy, Support, or Espionage.
* **Total Victory**: Red Bank has completed all of Diplomacy, Support, and Espionage.

Additionally, the players get bonus points for every track they have advantage in and for the level of difficulty chosen at the start of the campaign.

Any other state of the game after six sessions results in defeat for Red Bank.

# Components

## Resource Dice

Each resource has an associated pool of resource dice used by characters to overcome **obstacles**, fuel character abilities, and complete mission **progress cards**. At the end of each turn, players refill these pools to a number of dice equal to the value shown on the progress marker (1-6 dice).

Resource dice are colored as follows:

* **Support**: Yellow
* **Technology**: Orange
* **Espionage**: Red
* **Military**: Gray
* **Diplomacy**: Lavender
* **Sorcery**: Blue

`The dice in resource pools represent the raw capability of Red Bank in that area.`

## Assets

Resource dice are not very useful in resource pools, so players will frequently move them on to **location cards** first. Resource dice placed on location cards are referred to as **assets**. Assets are freely available for characters at that location to use.

`If resource pools are raw capabilities, assets are able to be utilized. Their form in the narrative is flexible. An espionage asset could represent anything from a helpful spy or contact to thieves tools or gear.`

## Action Dice

Each player has a pool of red action dice available each turn. These dice are spent to perform actions in the game. For some actions, the value on the action dice doesn't matter (such as moving from one location to another), but for most actions the value is important.

`Think of these like the action points in a game like Oath. Although the action points have values which can impact the abilitiy to take certain actions.`

## Character Tokens

There are tokens (miniatures in *Tabletop Simulator*) for each character in the campaign. These are moved around the nine different **location cards** during play.

## Location Cards

There are nine different location cards in play, three in each of the following regions:

| The Empire | Red Bank | The Settled Lands |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

<img src="rules_images/sample_location.png"/>

### Name

Each location card has a unique name listed at the top.

### Tags

Location cards have a variety of tags, mostly used by other card effects. All locations have one of the following tags: urban, rural, or wilderness. Additional tags include: eldritch, vault, tavern, port, and hall.

Along with the tags are one or more icons, as follows:

| Empire | Red Bank | Settled Lands | Starting | Sorcery Threat | Military Threat | Technology Threat | Discord |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stack.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/backstab.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Empire** - Imperial location, in the Empire locations deck and playable to the Empire region
* **Red Bank** - Red Bank location, in the Red Bank locations deck and playable to the Red Bank region
* **Settled Lands** - Settled Lands location, in the Settled Lands location deck and playable to the Settled Lands region
* **Starting Location** - In the default campaign mode, this is one of the nine starting location cards
* **Sorcery Threat** - Comes into play if the sorcery threat track reaches the final space
* **Military Threat** - Comes into play if the military threat track reaches the final space
* **Technology Threat** - Comes into play if the technology threat track reaches the final space
* **Discord** - Comes into play if one of the characters, Oniri, sustains too much stress (see below)

### Invest Skill

The upper right of each location card shows the skill icon used for the **invest** action. Investing is how resource dice are moved from resource pools into a location card.

### Movement Costs

Along the bottom of each card are movement costs for each region. A player spends the listed number of action dice (the value of the dice do not matter) to move their character to any location in that region.

### Effect Icon (Optional)

The upper left of each location card may contain optional icons indicating various effects.

| Port | Magic Gate | Support Source | Technology Source | Espionage Source | Military Source | Diplomacy Source | Sorcery Source |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/caravel.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/shatter.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/capitol.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cowled.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stone-throne.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Port**: A character may spend one action die to move from this location to another port location
* **Magic Gate**: A character may take on psyche stress (see below) to move from this location to another gate location
* **Support Source**: Roll and place a support die at this location when location is activated
* **Technology Source**: Roll and place a technology die at this location when location is activated
* **Espionage Source**: Roll and place an espionage die at this location when location is activated
* **Military Source**: Roll and place a military die at this location when location is activated
* **Diplomacy Source**: Roll and place a diplomacy die at this location when location is activated
* **Sorcery Source**: Roll and place a sorcery die at this location when location is activated

### Location Text (Optional)

Locations may have a variety of effect text as well. This text applies to any character at the location, or in some cases moving to the location. Most location text includes one of the following icons:

| Starting Obstacle | Action |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/up-card.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cube.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Starting Obstacle**: When this location is put into play, attach the listed obstacle(s) to it
* **Action**: By spending an action die (value doesn't matter), players may take the listed action

## Progress Cards

Progress cards are the main path to victory. Completing progress cards allows players to improve the progress tracks for Red Bank. Progress cards are completed by placing asset dice on them, creating an unbroken path from the starting position (the square with the diamonds on top) to the ending position (the square with diamonds on the bottom). From the starting position, dice are placed either orthogonally or diagonally in a chain towards the ending position. Typically there are many such paths from beginning to end which may be taken.

Asset dice may be moved from the character's location onto the progress card. This does not require an action. Most progress card squares have restrictions on dice that may be placed there. These restrictions are depicted by colors and symbols on each square. Symbols include:

* **Solid Colors**: Dice of the corresponding resource color must be placed there. Solid white squares are wildcards, and dice of any resource type and value may be placed there 
* **Dice Faces**: Dice matching the value must be placed there. If the die has a color, the color *and* value of the die must match. White dice must match the value, but may be of any resource type
* **Region Symbol**: Players may place assets of any resource type and value there, provided the character is in the region depicted. If the region symbol has a color, the character must be in a location matching the region and resource type
* **+1, -1, =**: The die placed must match the given relation to the previous die in the chain. The +1 die must be one higher in value than the previous die in the chain, the -1 die must be one lower, and the = die must be equal

### Reward

When a progress card is completed, the resource progress track listed on the bottom middle of the progress card is increased by one. Some progress cards have more than one resource symbol, in which case corresponding progress tracks are increased by one for each symbol. Finally, some progress cards have the following wild card symbol, which allows players to increase any progress track by one:

| Progress Wildcard |
| :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/swap-bag.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

### Obstacle Location

The lower right section of each progress card shows a location position, used during the **Obstacles** phase.

<img src="rules_images/sample_progress.png"/>

### On Two Fronts Example

The first square shows an icon for *Red Bank*. In order to put an asset die in this square, it must come from one of the three *Red Bank* locations. After the first die is place, the player has a choice: may go along the diagonal by placing a value five die of any resource type (white dice can be of any resource type), or place an espionage die (espionage dice are red) of any value below the starting position. The shortest path to the end is along the diagonal, but it is usually more difficult to match a particular die value.

Assuming the player places a five die, the next choice is continuing along the diagonal by placing a technology die of any value (technology dice are orange) or moving to the right by place any asset die (white squares can take a die of any resource type or value). It's a little longer to use the two wildcard spaces to get to the final space, but could be easier than finding a technology asset. Finally, the last space needs an asset dice from one of the three *Empire* locations.

Upon placing the die in the ending square, the progress card is completed. All of the resource dice are discarded and the military progress track is increased by one.

### Stages

The back of each progress card show the current stage and a difficulty for the stage, shown by a number of stars. These stars come into play when drawing obstacles in the **Obstacles** phase.

Progress cards are separated and grouped by stage. All the stage one cards are shuffled together, the stage two cards are shuffled together, etc. Players progress through stages as the game goes on. Over the course of the campaign, the lower stage cards are burned (removed from the campaign) such that later games in the campaign begin with the progress deck in later stages.

<img src="rules_images/sample_progress_back.png"/>

## Obstacle Cards

There is one deck of obstacle cards for each region (*The Empire*, *Red Bank*, and the *Settled Lands*). Over the course of the campaign, obstacle cards may move between decks, and decks may grow or shrink based on campaign events. Obstacle cards come into play during the **Obstacles** phase, causing effects which are usually negative for the characters and *Red Bank*.

<img src="rules_images/sample_obstacle.png"/>

### Name

Every obstacle card has a name, although they are not all unique. There are multiple copies of some obstacles.

### Tags

Below the name, as for location cards, are a set of text tags and icons for each obstacle. Similarly to locations, these text tags may interact with other obstacle cards, location effects, and character abilities.

Along with the tags each obstacle has one icon, which shows how it comes into play::

| Starting Obstacle | Location | Support Threat | Technology Threat | Espionage Threat | Military Threat | Diplomacy Threat | Sorcery Threat |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

### Difficulty

The upper left of the obstacle shows its difficulty from 1 to 6. This comes into play when taking the **Overcome Obstalce* action.

### Region

Below the difficulty is a region symbol. This shows which region deck the obstacle starts in. However, it is possible for obstacles to move to a different region deck.

### Threats

Along the right side of the obstacle are one or more threat icons, showing one of the six resources in the game. If there are *three* or more obstacles in play with the same obstacle symbol during the **Threats** phase, the threat track will increase.

### Effect

Many obstacles have text that details game effects while the obstacle is in play. Text may be preceded by the following symbols:

| Activated | Overcome |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/arrow-right.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/wide-arrow-dunk.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Activated**: This text takes effect if this obstacle is activated during the **Activation** phase
* **Overcome**: This text takes effect if the obstacle is overcome using the **Overcome Obstacle** action

### Skill

This character skill is used during the **Overcome Obstacle** action.

### Attack

Each obstacle may inflict psyche stress, body stress, or both. Each symbol in the lower left of the obstacle indicates one stress of the particular type. This may occur as part of the **Overcome Obstacle** action.

### Defend

To remove an obstacle from play (overcome the obstacle), players need to spend specific action dice matching the listed dice in the lower right of the obstacle during the **Overcome Obstacle** action.
