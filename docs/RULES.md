# Six Winters v19.3

*Six Winters* is a cooperative fantasy campaign game for 1-4 players based on the *Wrath of the Autarch* tabletop role-playing game.

Players control **Red Bank**, a diasporic society under threat from the **Empire of the Autarch**. The Autarch is working to achieve a sorcerous apotheosis, rendering The Empire unstoppable and spelling certain doom for Red Bank. The players have six winters to stop this from happening. Each game of Six Winters is 2 to 3 hours long and plays out one year in the life of Red Bank.

During a session of the game, players select from a rotating cast of characters to make progress against the Empire. Each character has their own unique capabilities and limitations. Effectively managing these characters over the six winters is critical to successfully stopping the Empire!

`As this document is very much in progress, designer thoughts and notes are captured using this highlighted formatting. They help provide context and insights, but are not essential to understanding the game. For now, I'm capturing rules in markdown, which is not a very rich textual format, but is quick to edit, and ideal for the state the game is in. The number of helpful images and diagrams is going be minimal, because they are difficult and time consuming to create for a game that is in such a fluid state. In other words: it isn't going to be easy to understand the game from the given rules doc, but hopefully it's at least possible. More than anything, I'm interested in capturing a specific version of the rules to help weight playtesting decisions. The version number matches that used in Tabletop Simulator. Along with that, all of the graphic design and layout is only for prototype purposes and will certainly change at production time.`

## Resources

Characters leverage six **resources** to make progress against the Empire:

| Support | Technology | Espionage | Military | Diplomacy | Sorcery |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/capitol.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cowled.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stone-throne.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> |
 
Red Bank's **progress** in those areas is marked using a red cube on each associated twelve space **resource track**.

## Threats

**Threat levels** against Red Bank in each resource area are tracked using a gray cube on each resource track. If Red Bank's progress is higher than the associated threat marker, the players have **advantage** in that resource, which confers mechanical advantages during play. There are ways to slow the rate of threats and even lower threat levels during play.

`Lowering threat levels after they have advanced is much more difficult than trying to slow the rate of advancement in the first place. Completely stopping threat advancements requires some luck.`

## Victory

If the Red Bank progress marker is _alone_ on the last space of a resource track, that resource track is **complete**. After the sixth game, check for victory as follows:

* **Pyrrhic Victory**: Red Bank has completed one of Diplomacy, Support, or Espionage.
* **Major Victory**: Red Bank has completed any two of Diplomacy, Support, or Espionage.
* **Total Victory**: Red Bank has completed all of Diplomacy, Support, and Espionage.

Additionally, the players get bonus points for every track they have advantage in and for the level of difficulty chosen at the start of the campaign.

Any other state of the game after six sessions results in defeat for Red Bank.

# Components

## Resource Dice

Each resource has an associated pool of resource dice used by characters to overcome **obstacles**, fuel character abilities, and complete mission **progress cards**. At the end of each turn, players refill these pools to a number of dice equal to the value shown on the progress marker (1-6 dice).

Resource dice are colored as follows:

* **Support**: Yellow
* **Technology**: Orange
* **Espionage**: Red
* **Military**: Gray
* **Diplomacy**: Lavender
* **Sorcery**: Blue

`The dice in resource pools represent the raw capability of Red Bank in that area.`

## Assets

Resource dice are not very useful in resource pools, so players will frequently move them on to **location cards** first. Resource dice placed on location cards are referred to as **assets**. Assets are freely available for characters at that location to use.

`If resource pools are raw capabilities, assets are able to be utilized. Their form in the narrative is flexible. An espionage asset could represent anything from a helpful spy or contact to thieves tools or gear.`

## Action Dice

Each player has a pool of red action dice available each turn. These dice are spent to perform actions in the game. For some actions, the value on the action dice doesn't matter (such as moving from one location to another), but for most actions the value is important.

`Think of these like the action points in a game like Oath. Although the action points have values which can impact the abilitiy to take certain actions.`

## Character Tokens

There are tokens (miniatures in *Tabletop Simulator*) for each character in the campaign. These are moved around the nine different **location cards** during play.

## Location Cards

There are nine different location cards in play during a game, three in each of the following regions:

| The Empire | Red Bank | The Settled Lands |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

<img src="rules_images/sample_location.png"/>

### Name

Each location card has a unique name listed at the top.

### Tags

Location cards have a variety of tags, mostly used by other card effects. All locations have one of the following tags: urban, rural, or wilderness. Additional tags include: eldritch, vault, tavern, port, and hall.

Along with the tags are one or more icons, as follows:

| Empire | Red Bank | Settled Lands | Starting | Sorcery Threat | Military Threat | Technology Threat | Discord |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stack.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/backstab.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Empire** - Imperial location, in the Empire locations deck and playable to the Empire region
* **Red Bank** - Red Bank location, in the Red Bank locations deck and playable to the Red Bank region
* **Settled Lands** - Settled Lands location, in the Settled Lands location deck and playable to the Settled Lands region
* **Starting Location** - In the default campaign mode, this is one of the nine starting location cards
* **Sorcery Threat** - Comes into play if the sorcery threat track reaches the final space
* **Military Threat** - Comes into play if the military threat track reaches the final space
* **Technology Threat** - Comes into play if the technology threat track reaches the final space
* **Discord** - Comes into play if one of the characters, Oniri, sustains too much stress (see below)

### Create Asset Skill

The upper right of each location card shows the skill icon used for the **Create Asset** action. Creating assets moves resource dice from resource pools onto a location card.

### Movement Costs

Along the bottom of each card are movement costs for each region. A player spends the listed number of action dice (the value of the dice do not matter) to move their character to any location in that region.

### Effect Icon (Optional)

The upper left of each location card may contain optional icons indicating various effects.

| Port | Magic Gate | Support Source | Technology Source | Espionage Source | Military Source | Diplomacy Source | Sorcery Source |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/caravel.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/shatter.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/capitol.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cowled.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stone-throne.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Port**: A character may spend one action die to move from this location to another port location
* **Magic Gate**: A character may take on psyche stress (see below) to move from this location to another gate location
* **Support Source**: Roll and place a support die at this location when location is activated
* **Technology Source**: Roll and place a technology die at this location when location is activated
* **Espionage Source**: Roll and place an espionage die at this location when location is activated
* **Military Source**: Roll and place a military die at this location when location is activated
* **Diplomacy Source**: Roll and place a diplomacy die at this location when location is activated
* **Sorcery Source**: Roll and place a sorcery die at this location when location is activated

### Location Text (Optional)

Locations may have a variety of effect text as well. This text applies to any character at the location, or in some cases moving to the location. Most location text includes one of the following icons:

| Starting Obstacle | Action |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/up-card.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cube.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Starting Obstacle**: When this location is put into play, attach the listed obstacle(s) to it
* **Action**: By spending an action die (value doesn't matter), players may take the listed action

## Progress Cards

Progress cards are the main path to victory. Completing progress cards allows players to improve the progress tracks for Red Bank. Progress cards are completed by placing asset dice on them, creating an unbroken path from the starting position (the square with the diamonds on top) to the ending position (the square with diamonds on the bottom). From the starting position, dice are placed either orthogonally or diagonally in a chain towards the ending position. Typically there are many such paths from beginning to end which may be taken.

Asset dice may be moved from the character's location onto the progress card. This does not require an action. Most progress card squares have restrictions on dice that may be placed there. These restrictions are depicted by colors and symbols on each square. Symbols include:

* **Solid Colors**: Dice of the corresponding resource color must be placed there. Solid white squares are wildcards, and dice of any resource type and value may be placed there 
* **Dice Faces**: Dice matching the value must be placed there. If the die has a color, the color *and* value of the die must match. White dice must match the value, but may be of any resource type
* **Region Symbol**: Players may place assets of any resource type and value there, provided the character is in the region depicted. If the region symbol has a color, the character must be in a location matching the region and resource type
* **+1, -1, =**: The die placed must match the given relation to the previous die in the chain. The +1 die must be one higher in value than the previous die in the chain, the -1 die must be one lower, and the = die must be equal

### Reward

When a progress card is completed, the resource progress track listed on the bottom middle of the progress card is increased by one. Some progress cards have more than one resource symbol, in which case corresponding progress tracks are increased by one for each symbol. Finally, some progress cards have the following wild card symbol, which allows players to increase any progress track by one:

| Progress Wildcard |
| :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/swap-bag.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

### Obstacle Location

The lower right section of each progress card shows a location position, used during the **Obstacles** phase.

<img src="rules_images/sample_progress.png"/>

### On Two Fronts Example

The first square shows an icon for *Red Bank*. In order to put an asset die in this square, it must come from one of the three *Red Bank* locations. After the first die is place, the player has a choice: may go along the diagonal by placing a value five die of any resource type (white dice can be of any resource type), or place an espionage die (espionage dice are red) of any value below the starting position. The shortest path to the end is along the diagonal, but it is usually more difficult to match a particular die value.

Assuming the player places a five die, the next choice is continuing along the diagonal by placing a technology die of any value (technology dice are orange) or moving to the right by place any asset die (white squares can take a die of any resource type or value). It's a little longer to use the two wildcard spaces to get to the final space, but could be easier than finding a technology asset. Finally, the last space needs an asset dice from one of the three *Empire* locations.

Upon placing the die in the ending square, the progress card is completed. All of the resource dice are discarded and the military progress track is increased by one.

### Stages and Difficulty

The back of each progress card show the current stage and a difficulty for the stage, shown by a number of stars. These stars come into play when drawing obstacles in the **Obstacles** phase.

Progress cards are separated and grouped by stage. All the stage one cards are shuffled together, the stage two cards are shuffled together, etc. Players progress through stages as the game goes on. Over the course of the campaign, the lower stage cards are burned (removed from the campaign) such that later games in the campaign begin with the progress deck in later stages.

<img src="rules_images/sample_progress_back.png"/>

## Obstacle Cards

There is one deck of obstacle cards for each region (*The Empire*, *Red Bank*, and the *Settled Lands*). Over the course of the campaign, obstacle cards may move between decks, and decks may grow or shrink based on campaign events. Obstacle cards come into play during the **Obstacles** phase, causing effects which are usually negative for the characters and *Red Bank*.

<img src="rules_images/sample_obstacle.png"/>

### Name

Every obstacle card has a name, although they are not all unique. There are multiple copies of some obstacles.

### Tags

Below the name, as for location cards, are a set of text tags and icons for each obstacle. Similarly to locations, these text tags may interact with other obstacle cards, location effects, and character abilities.

Along with the tags each obstacle has one icon, which shows how it comes into play::

| Starting Obstacle | Location | Support Threat | Technology Threat | Espionage Threat | Military Threat | Diplomacy Threat | Sorcery Threat |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/stack.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/up-card.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/capitol.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cowled.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stone-throne.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Starting Obstacle** - This obstacle starts the campaign in one of the three regional obstacle decks, based on its region symbol
* **Location** - This obstacle comes into play attached to the location with the obstacle's name in its text box
* **Support Threat** - This obstacle comes into play at the end of a session if the support threat track is increased at or above the obstacle difficult
* **Technology Threat** - This obstacle comes into play at the end of a session if the technology threat track is increased at or above the obstacle difficult
* **Espionage Threat** - This obstacle comes into play at the end of a session if the espionage threat track is increased at or above the obstacle difficult
* **Military Threat** - This obstacle comes into play at the end of a session if the military threat track is increased at or above the obstacle difficult
* **Diplomacy Threat** - This obstacle comes into play at the end of a session if the diplomacy threat track is increased at or above the obstacle difficult
* **Sorcery Threat** - This obstacle comes into play at the end of a session if the sorcery threat track is increased at or above the obstacle difficult

### Difficulty

The upper left of the obstacle shows its difficulty from 1 to 6. This comes into play when taking the **Overcome Obstalce* action.

### Region

Below the difficulty is a region symbol. This shows which region deck the obstacle starts in. However, it is possible for obstacles to move to a different region deck.

### Threats

Along the right side of the obstacle are one or more threat icons, showing one of the six resources in the game. If there are *three* or more obstacles in play with the same obstacle symbol during the **Threats** phase, the threat track will increase.

### Effect

Many obstacles have text that details game effects while the obstacle is in play. Text may be preceded by the following symbols:

| Activated | Overcome |
| :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/arrow-right.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/wide-arrow-dunk.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Activated**: This text takes effect if this obstacle is activated during the **Activation** phase
* **Overcome**: This text takes effect if the obstacle is overcome using the **Overcome Obstacle** action

### Skill

This character skill is used during the **Overcome Obstacle** action.

### Attack

Each obstacle may inflict psyche stress, body stress, or both. Each symbol in the lower left of the obstacle indicates one stress of the particular type. This may occur as part of the **Overcome Obstacle** action.

### Defense

To remove an obstacle from play (overcome the obstacle), players need to spend specific action dice matching the listed dice in the lower right of the obstacle during the **Overcome Obstacle** action.

### Season Sybmol

The back of each obstacle card shows one of four season symbols, as follows:

| Spring | Summer | Fall | Winter |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/sprout-disc.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/sunrise.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/oat.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/frozen-orb.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

Since there are three obstacle decks, one for each region, there are 0 to 3 symbols of a particular type showing at any time. This affects which locations get activated during the **Activation** phase, which seasonal event card comes into play during the **Seasonal Events** phase, as well as how many turns players get each season.

<img src="rules_images/sample_obstacle_back.png"/>

## Seasonal Event Cards

At the beginning of each turn a seasonal event card comes into play, based on the number of season symbols showing on the obstacle decks. There is one seasonal event card for each possible number of symbols between 0 and 4. Typically the seasonal events with lower numbers have more desirable effects for players.

<img src="rules_images/sample_event.png"/>

### Season Symbol

The upper right of each seasonal event shows which season it belongs to. There are four seasonal events for each season.

### Matching Number of Symbols

The number in the upper left matches the number of season symbols of that type in play. For instance, if it is the fall season, and there is one fall symbol showing among the three obstacle decks, the *Harvest Festivals* seasonal event comes into play at the beginning of the turn.

## Trade Board

The trade board tracks time, progress tracks, threat tracks, holds resource dice, and contains spots for progress cards and seasonal events.

<img src="rules_images/trade_board.png"/>

### Resource Pools

There are six resource pools on the trade board. At the end of each turn, players refill these pools to a number of dice equal to the value shown on the progress marker (1-6 dice). When refilling resource pools, dice already in the pool are *not* rerolled.

### Progress and Threat Tracks

Both progress and threats are tracked on each resource track. Red cubes are used to track Red Bank's progress and gray cubes are used to track the current threat level in that area.

### Create Asset Slots

On each resource pool are numbered **Create Asset Slots** from 0 to 6. These are used by characters to retrieve resource dice from each pool using the **Create Asset** action.

### Wheel of Seasons

Each session starts in the winter. There are one or two turns per season. Game turns are tracked on the wheel of seasons, starting with the second winter space marked in green.

### Wheel of Years

Years may be tracked on the trade board, starting at year one and ending at year six. Each game advances time by one year.

### Progress

In order to win, players must complete **progress cards**. Each progress card allows the players to make progress on one or more resource tracks. During play, there are four progress cards displayed face up on the trade board. When players complete one progress card, they select the next one from the four available cards. This is described in more detail below.

## Location Board

Obstacles, locations, and characters are put into play on the location board.

<img src="rules_images/location_board.png"/>

### Regions

The location board is broken up into three regions, from left to right: *The Empire*, *Red Bank*, and *The Settled Lands*.

### Locations and Resource Slots

Each region has a space to place three locations. Each space has a matching **location resource slot**. When placing locations on the location board, cover the region symbol and leave the resource slot symbol showing. The resource slot is used during the **create asset** action.

`There is one location resource slot for each resource track with a victory condition, and two for the other three resources.`

# Campaign Setup

When starting a new campaign, undertake the following steps. The campaign may be played more than once, although it is not possible to play multiple campaigns at the same time.

1. Set Initial Progress
2. Set Initial Threat Levels
3. Choose Starting Locations
4. Assemble Starting Obstacle Decks
5. Assemble New Character Sheets

## Set Initial Progress

The red cubes are used to track *Red Bank's* progress on each resource track. At the start of the campaign, the red cubes are placed on the first space of each track (the space in the upper left surrouding each resource pool). All resource pools start at size 1 except support, which is at size 2.

## Set Initial Threat Levels

The first step is to determine the difficulty of the campaign. Initial threat levels are based on difficulty. Place gray cubes at the appropriate position of each resource track:

* **Cakewalk**: First space, on same space as red progress cubes
* **Standard**: Third space
* **Difficult**: Sixth space
* **Impossible**: Ninth space, only three away from the last space of the track, when particularly bad effects kick in

At the standard and cakewalk difficulties, there's a very high chance of at least a pyrrhic victory. The game at those levels is more about what happens to characters along the way and the degree of success. At the difficult and impossible levels, there's a chance the players will not succeed at all.

## Choose Starting Locations

The first time playing the campaign, it is suggested players use the standard starting locations. These are basic locations with no special effects text or symbols. They also cover a wide range of character skills, thus allowing any of the starting characters to have success. Use the following table to set up standard starting locations, placing one location in each slot on the location board:

| Region | Resource | Location Name |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Eastkeep |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Guild of Strategy |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cowled.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Whitehold |
| <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Dusk's Ayrie |
| <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/capitol.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Ferry's Glenn |
| <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Gray Forest |
| <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stone-throne.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Lily Manor |
| <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Boar's Peak |
| <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> | Gravewood |

### Random Starting Locations

Alternatively, shuffle the location cards by region. Then draw four cards from each region, and choose three to put into play as desired. If any locations have attached obstacles, find and put those into play now.

`This is suggested for experienced players who don't mind having lots of location effects in play, and potentially more restrictive combinations of skills for creating assets.`

## Assemble Starting Obstacle Decks

Divide up the starting obstacles by region, and shuffle each of these decks to form one draw pile in each region. Set aside the threat obstacles and location obstacles.

## Assemble New Character Sheets

Get new character sheets for the seven characters in the game. At the start of a new campaign Oniri, Yasmnia, and Lucia are locked.

# Session Setup

Perform the following steps at the start of each session.

1. Fill Starting Resource and Action Dice Pools
2. Choose Characters
3. Place Obstacle Decks and Locations
4. Build Progress Deck
5. Select Starting Progress Cards
6. Place Characters at Locations
7. Place Season Time Marker

## Fill Starting Resource and Action Dice Pools

Roll and place a number of resource dice for each pool equal to the current pool size under progress marker.

Additionally, each player rolls red dice for their starting action dice pool. For the 2-4 player game, each player rolls 5 action dice. For the solo game, roll 7 action dice.

## Choose Characters

Each player should choose one unlocked character. If playing solo, choose two characters.

## Place Obstacle Decks and Locations

Shuffle and place each obstacle deck in the draw pile for that region. Retrieve locations and attached obstacles from the previous game and put them into play.

## Build Progress Deck

Gather all progress cards in play, and group them by stage. Shuffle each stage separately, then place them into one draw pile, organized by stage with lowest stage at the top and the highest stage at the bottom.

## Select Starting Progress Cards

Each player draws two progress cards and chooses one to start with. The cards not selected are placed in the progress staging area in any order desired.

If this is the first game of a new campaign, draw and place one obstacle at the obstacle location for each progress card. This is the location indicated in the lower right of the progress card.

## Place Characters at Locations

Finally, each player may place a token for their character at any desired location.

## Place Season Time Marker

Turns are tracked using the season time marker. The game starts in winter. Place the season time marker on the solid winter box.

# Turns

A turn in *Six Winters* is composed of the following phases.

1. Seasonal Event
2. Actions
3. Refill
4. Activation
5. New Obstacles
6. Threats
7. Obstacle Surge
8. Advance Time

## Seasonal Event

Gather the four seasonal event cards for the current season. Put the seasonal event card into play which matches the number of currently showing season symbols (between 0 and 3) on the back of the three obstacle decks. Follow instructions on seasonal event card.

`Typically the higher number seasonal event cards are more difficult for players.`

## Actions

The action phase is the main part of each turn. During the actions phase, players spend their action dice to perform actions. Actions may be taken in any order by any player. When no players have any more action dice, the actions phase is complete. See **Actions** below for a detailed explanation of all possible actions.

Character abilities are normally used during this phase as well.

## Refill

Dice are rolled and added to each resource pool until there are a number of dice matching the progress number for that pool. Do not reroll any resource dice already in the pool, and do not remove any dice if there are more dice in the pool than the progress number indicates.

## Activation

Starting with the Empire region, and ending with the Settled Lands, activate locations and obstacles based on the season symbol showing for that region. The spring symbol activates the top location card and any attached obstacles are activated, the summer symbol activates the middle location and obstacles, the fall symbol activates the bottom location and obstacles, and the winter symbol activates *all* locations and obstacles in the region.

Follow any activated effect text on activated locations and obstacles.

## New Obstacles

Draw and place new obstacles equal to the current stage difficulty (the number of stars on the back of the top card in the progress deck).

To place an obstacle:

* Look at the lowest card in the progress staging area
* Place an obstacle at the obstacle location on this progress card (in the lower right of progress card)
* Discard the progress card

There will now be a number of open positions in the progress staging area equal to the current stage difficulty. After placing obstacles, slide down any remaining progress cards so they fill the lowest staging area positions, and refill any open progress staging card positions at the top by drawing from the progress deck.

## Threats

Raise each threat track by one for every matching threat symbol on obstacle cards beyond two. For instance, if there are 4 military thret icons on the obstacle cards, the military threat track will increase by 2. If there are 3 diplomacy threat icons on obstacles, the diplomacy threat track will increase by 1, etc.

If a threat track is already at the highest position (step 12 on the track), increase the next threat track in trade order. For instance, if the support track is maxed out, increase technology instead. If sorcery is maxed out, players may choose which track to increase.

`Unless playing at a very hard difficulty, maxing out a threat track is fairly rare, and typically only happens near the end of the campaign.`

## Obstacle Surge

In a three player game, place one more obstacle in play, following the **New Obstacles** steps above. In a four player game, place two new obstacles following the **New Obstacles** steps.

`Three and four player games have more obstacles, but they come out after determining threats.`

## Advance Time

The final step of the turn is to advance the seasonal time marker. Only advance to the second turn of a season, as indicated by a dotted box around the season symbol, if one or more matching symbols are on the obstacle cards. If the time marker advances back to the first winter symbol, the game is over. If this was the sixth game, the campaign is over.

`There are between 4 and 8 turns in a game.`

# Actions

Spending action dice to take actions makes up the core of *Six Winters*. Most character abilities are used during this phase, by manipulating action dice, assets, or resource pool dice. Players may only take actions at the location where their character is currently at.

* Move
* Create Asset
* Trade
* Overcome
* Location Action

`If playing solo, may take actions at either character location.`

## Move

Every location card lists action dice costs for traveling to each region in the game. To move to a different location, spend a number of action dice equal to the amount indicated for the destination location's region. The value of the action dice don't matter.

Some locations have restrictions on what regions can be moved to directly. For instance, characters can only move from *Whitehold* to other Imperial locations.

## Create Asset

This action moves resource pool dice matching the location's resource slot to the location where the character is at. Asset dice are free to use by any character at the location, usually for filling in progress cards, so this is a very common action. The steps to create an asset are:

1. Place an action die on an open create asset slot for the pool matching the location's resource
    * The action die must be placed in an open slot less than or equal to the character's skill for creating assets at this location
2. Move a resource die from pool that is **less than or equal to** the value of the placed action die

Note that the support progress bonus allows players to move **all** resource dice matching the value of the action die. This allows players to potentially create multiple assets with one action die.

## Trade

Trade works similarly to creating assets, although it allows players to move resource dice between pools. The steps to trade are:

1. Place an action die on an open action slot for the pool matching the location's resource
    * The action die must be placed in an open slot less than or equal to the character's skill for resource actions at this location
2. Move a resource die into or out of this pool that is **less than or equal to** the value of the placed die
    * The dice are moved along the wheel of trade (support -> technology, technology -> espionage, etc.)
    * When a die is moved from one resource pool to another, it changes type
    * Dice from the sorcery pool may move into any other resource pool, but no resource may by converted to sorcery dice

## Overcome

Overcome allows players to discard obstacles from the location board where their character is located. To overcome an obstacle, dice must be placed on the obstacle matching the dice values in the defense pattern. This is done by:

1. Approach
2. Defend
3. Overcome

### Approach

May place a number of action dice on the obstacle, up to the character's skill value for the obstacle. If the character has a skill of 0 for the obstacle, no dice may be placed on approach.

If, after this step, the obstacle has dice on it matching the defense pattern, it is immediately overcome. Skip the defend step and move on to overcome.

### Defend

All remaining action dice for the character are rerolled. If the character's skill is equal to or higher than the obstacle's difficulty, the character successfully defends if any rerolled action dice are 3 or less. Otherwise, the character successfully defends if any rerolled action dice are 1.

If the character doesn't successfully defend, they take the amount of stress listed for the obstacle's attack.

### Overcome

Any of the action dice used to defend may be placed on the obstacle to help overcome it. If, after this stage, the obstacle has dice on it matching its defense, it is overcome. When an obstacle is overcome, it is discarded to the current region's discard deck. Some obstacles have other effects when they are overcome, as indicated with an overcome icon.

Finally, if the character's skill for the obstacle is less than the difficulty, **they may increase their skill by one**. Characters improve their skills by overcoming difficult obstacles.

If the obstacle doesn't have dice on it matching the pattern, leave any dice on it. Further dice may be added with more overcome actions on the same or future turns.

### Teamwork

Multiple characters may work together to overcome an obstacle, provided of course they are at the same location where the obstacle is. In this case, both players may add dice and check for success during the approach. Both characters will defend if *either* player successfully defends, and both players may overcome the obstacle. 

Either or both characters may increase their skills, as long as the character's skill is less than the obstacle's difficulty as normal.

## Location Action

Some locations allow characters there to spend an action die to perform the listed effect. The value of this action die doesn't matter.
