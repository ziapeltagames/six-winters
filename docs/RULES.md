# Six Winters

**Six Winters** is a cooperative fantasy campaign game for 1-4 players based on the **Wrath of the Autarch** tabletop role-playing game.

Players control **Red Bank**, a diasporic society under threat from the **Empire of the Autarch**. The Autarch is working to achieve a sorcerous apotheosis, rendering The Empire unstoppable and spelling certain doom for Red Bank. The players have six winters to stop this from happening. Each game of Six Winters is 2 to 3 hours long and plays out one year in the life of Red Bank.

During a session of the game, players select from a rotating cast of characters to make progress against the Empire. Each character has their own unique capabilities and limitations. Effectively managing these characters over the six winters is critical to successfully stopping the Empire!

`As this document is very much changing and in progress, designer thoughts and notes are captured using this highlighted formatting. They help provide context and insights, but are not essential to understanding the game. For now, I'm capturing rules in markdown, which is not a very rich textual format, but is quick to edit, and ideal for the state the game is in. The number of helpful images and diagrams is going be minimal, because they are difficult and time consuming to create for a game that is in such a fluid state. In other words: it isn't going to be super easy to understand the game from the given rules doc, but hopefully it's at least possible.`

## Resources

Characters leverage six **resources** to make progress against the Empire:

| Stability | Technology | Espionage | Military | Diplomacy | Sorcery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <img src="rules_images/capitol.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cowled.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stone-throne.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> |
 
 Red Bank's **progress** in those areas is marked using a red cube on each associated **resource track**.

## Threats

**Threat levels** against Red Bank in each resource area are tracked using a gray cube on each resource track. If Red Bank's progress is higher than the associated threat marker, the players have **advantage** in that resource, which confers mechanical advantages during play. There are ways to slow the rate of threats and even lower threat levels during play.

`Lowering threat levels after they have advanced is much more difficult than trying to slow the rate of advancement in the first place. Completely stopping threat advancements requires some luck.`

## Victory

If the Red Bank progress marker is _alone_ on the last space of a resource track, that resource track is **complete**. After the sixth game, check for victory as follows:

* **Pyrrhic Victory**: Red Bank has completed one of Diplomacy, Support, or Espionage.
* **Major Victory**: Red Bank has completed any two of Diplomacy, Support, or Espionage.
* **Total Victory**: Red Bank has completed all of Diplomacy, Support, and Espionage.

Additionally, the players get bonus points for every track they have advantage in and for the level of difficulty chosen at the start of the campaign.

Any other state of the game after six sessions results in defeat for Red Bank.
