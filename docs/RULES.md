## Card Types

* Hand - Cards that are held in a player's hand.
   * They are usually played as interrupts, whenever the player wants.
      * Occasionally they must be played during a specific phase, usually the refresh phase.   
   * Sometimes there are restrictions on how they can be played, for example, only on a character at a wilderness location, only by spending certain resources, etc.
* Location - These are places that characters can be, they typically have actions on them that characters can do.
   * Spotlight locations are places the player's have found that they put into play at the start of a mission.
* Attachment - Cards that attach to a location or a character and affect it somehow.
   * Conditions, environments, challenges.
* Event - These cards do something and then are usually discarded.
* Obstacle - These cards go into the obstacle area for the given mission and might be triggered by progress cards.
* Lifepath - Character lifepath cards are placed into the progress deck at the start of the mission.
* Discord - Character discord cards are placed into the progress deck at the start of the mission.

## Tags

Tags might appear on cards to give them more flavor and pair with character abilities. Cards don't have to have tags.

Common tags: Wilderness, Urban, Red Bank, Sorcery, Guard, Undead, Beast, Diplomat, Trap, Challenge, Environment, Condition, Asset, Resource, Secret, Favor

## Triggers

Cards may also have triggers that restrict how they are played.

Example triggers: Season End, Burn, On Entering Play, Lowest, Solo, Group, Completion

## Card Decks

Finally, the different types of cards get placed into different decks depending on how they're used.

* Progress - Each player uses a progress deck that triggers locations and obstacles
* Developments - These cards are available for purchase during the game, later they are placed in the progress deck at the start of the mission
* Mission - There are mission decks for the current mission that feature locations and various cards that may be retrieved as specified on the mission
* Encounter - The encounter deck for the mission has random events characters encounter via progress deck triggers
* Threats - Threat cards can come into play in the spotlight area during the mission
