# Six Winters

**Six Winters** is a two player cooperative fantasy campaign game based on the **Wrath of the Autarch** tabletop role-playing game.

Both players control **Amaranthia**, a diasporic society that is under constant threat from the **Empire of the Autarch**. The Autarch is working to achieve a sorcerous **apotheosis**, rendering her unstoppable and spelling certain doom for Amaranthia. The players have six winters to stop this from happening.

## Status Tracks

**Technology**, **Sorcery**, **Stability**, and **Diplomacy** levels within Amaranthia, along with the current **Imperial Rebellion** status are recorded using status tracks from 0-10.

## Resource Tracks

Resource tracks from 1-5 for **Food**, **Ore**, **Luxuries**, **Timber**, and **Mana**

## Victory

The players achieve victory in one of three ways:

* **Grand Unification**: Unite the scattered factions of the realm while also maintaining peace at home. This is achieved if the Stability and Diplomacy tracks are both at 10 during any winter.
* **Imperial Rebellion**: Overthrow the leadership within the Empire by inciting unrest and fomenting rebellion. This is achieved if the Imperial Rebellion track is at 10 during any winter.
* **Sorcerous Knowledge**: Learn the sorcerous secrets necessary to stop the Autarch directly. This is achieved if the Sorcery track is at 10 during any winter.

## Defeat

The players lose the game if either of the following occur:

* **Collapse**: If the Stability track ever drops down to 0, Amaranthia collapses into anarchy.
* **Six Winters**: If the players have not won by the sixth winter, the Autarch achieves apotheosis and overthrows Amaranthia.


Each session, players choose missions to undertake, which are represented by different decks of cards. Players select characters for the mission from a growing character pool, taking into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of each character. A mission takes about ninety minutes to play. The design goal is to make a game for nerdy couples who enjoy a game with a strong narrative that can be played on a weeknight. 

Along the way, seasons will pass, the characters will grow and change, and players will make choices about the strategic direction for Red Bank.
