# Six Winters v19.3

*Six Winters* is a cooperative fantasy campaign game for 1-4 players based on the *Wrath of the Autarch* tabletop role-playing game.

Players control **Red Bank**, a diasporic society under threat from the **Empire of the Autarch**. The Autarch is working to achieve a sorcerous apotheosis, rendering The Empire unstoppable and spelling certain doom for Red Bank. The players have six winters to stop this from happening. Each game of Six Winters is 2 to 3 hours long and plays out one year in the life of Red Bank.

During a session of the game, players select from a rotating cast of characters to make progress against the Empire. Each character has their own unique capabilities and limitations. Effectively managing these characters over the six winters is critical to successfully stopping the Empire!

`As this document is very much in progress, designer thoughts and notes are captured using this highlighted formatting. They help provide context and insights, but are not essential to understanding the game. For now, I'm capturing rules in markdown, which is not a very rich textual format, but is quick to edit, and ideal for the state the game is in. The number of helpful images and diagrams is going be minimal, because they are difficult and time consuming to create for a game that is in such a fluid state. In other words: it isn't going to be easy to understand the game from the given rules doc, but hopefully it's at least possible. More than anything, I'm interested in capturing a specific version of the rules to help weight playtesting decisions. The version number matches that used in Tabletop Simulator. Along with that, all of the graphic design and layout is only for prototype purposes and will certainly change at production time.`

## Resources

Characters leverage six **resources** to make progress against the Empire:

| Support | Technology | Espionage | Military | Diplomacy | Sorcery |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/capitol.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/cowled.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stone-throne.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> |
 
Red Bank's **progress** in those areas is marked using a red cube on each associated twelve space **resource track**.

## Threats

**Threat levels** against Red Bank in each resource area are tracked using a gray cube on each resource track. If Red Bank's progress is higher than the associated threat marker, the players have **advantage** in that resource, which confers mechanical advantages during play. There are ways to slow the rate of threats and even lower threat levels during play.

`Lowering threat levels after they have advanced is much more difficult than trying to slow the rate of advancement in the first place. Completely stopping threat advancements requires some luck.`

## Victory

If the Red Bank progress marker is _alone_ on the last space of a resource track, that resource track is **complete**. After the sixth game, check for victory as follows:

* **Pyrrhic Victory**: Red Bank has completed one of Diplomacy, Support, or Espionage.
* **Major Victory**: Red Bank has completed any two of Diplomacy, Support, or Espionage.
* **Total Victory**: Red Bank has completed all of Diplomacy, Support, and Espionage.

Additionally, the players get bonus points for every track they have advantage in and for the level of difficulty chosen at the start of the campaign.

Any other state of the game after six sessions results in defeat for Red Bank.

# Components

## Resource Dice

Each resource has an associated pool of resource dice used by characters to overcome **obstacles**, fuel character abilities, and complete mission **progress cards**. At the end of each turn, players refill these pools to a number of dice equal to the value shown on the progress marker (1-6 dice).

Resource dice are colored as follows:

* **Support**: Yellow
* **Technology**: Orange
* **Espionage**: Red
* **Military**: Gray
* **Diplomacy**: Lavender
* **Sorcery**: Blue

`The dice in resource pools represent the raw capability of Red Bank in that area.`

## Assets

Resource dice are not very useful in resource pools, so players will frequently move them on to **location cards** first. Resource dice placed on location cards are referred to as **assets**. Assets are freely available for characters at that location to use.

`If resource pools are raw capabilities, assets are able to be utilized. Their form in the narrative is flexible. An espionage asset could represent anything from a helpful spy or contact to thieves tools or gear.`

## Action Dice

Each player has a pool of red action dice available each turn. These dice are spent to perform actions in the game. For some actions, the value on the action dice doesn't matter (such as moving from one location to another), but for most actions the value is important.

`Think of these like the action points in a game like Oath. Although the action points have values which can impact the abilitiy to take certain actions.`

## Character Tokens

There are tokens (miniatures in *Tabletop Simulator*) for each character in the campaign. These are moved around the nine different **location cards** during play.

## Locations

There are nine different location cards in play, three in each of the following regions:

| The Empire | Red Bank | The Settled Lands |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

<img src="rules_images/sample_location.png"/>

### Name

Each location card has a unique name listed at the top.

### Tags

Location cards have a variety of tags, mostly used by other card effects. All locations have one of the following tags: urban, rural, or wilderness. Additional tags include: eldritch, vault, tavern, port, and hall.

Along with the tags are one or more icons, as follows:

| Empire | Red Bank | Settled Lands | Starting | Sorcery Threat | Military Threat | Technology Threat | Discord |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| <img src="rules_images/defensive-wall.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/holy-oak.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/water-mill.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/stack.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/magic-swirl.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/catapult.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/spyglass.png" width="100" height="100" /> | <img src="rules_images/backstab.png" width="100" height="100" /> |

* **Empire** - Imperial location, in the Empire locations deck and playable to the Empire region
* **Red Bank** - Red Bank location, in the Red Bank locations deck and playable to the Red Bank region

### Invest Skill

The upper right of each location card shows the skill icon used for the **invest** action. Investing is how resource dice are moved from resource pools into a location card.

### Movement Costs

Along the bottom of each card are movement costs for each region. A player spends the listed number of action dice (the value of the dice do not matter) to move their character to any location in that region.

## Resource Pools

 At the end of each turn, players refill these pools to a number of dice equal to the value shown on the progress marker (1-6 dice).

## Investment Slots

On each resource pool are numbered **investment slots** from 0 to 6. These are used by characters to retrieve resource dice from each pool.

## Wheel of Seasons

Each session starts in the winter. There are one or two turns per season. Game turns are tracked on the wheel of seasons, starting with the second winter space marked in green.

## Wheel of Years

Years may be tracked on the trade board, starting at year one and ending at year six. Each game advances time by one year.

## Progress

In order to win, players must complete **progress cards**. Each progress card allows the players to make progress on one or more resource tracks. During play, there are four progress cards displayed face up on the trade board. When players complete one progress card, they select the next one from the four available cards. This is described in more detail below.
