# Pathfinder CG (Deck Based Missions)

Locations are abstract, leans into decks of cards to represent opponents and obstacles.

The character decks are built from specific gear, spells, etc. That's not a bad way of building up characters from more atomic elements, although having preset decks is faster to get started. Inspiration could be gained from some of the card effects, however.
