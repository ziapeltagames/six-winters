#  Sunrider / North Oaks Season One Playtest

Played through an alliance mission (Sunriders) and an exploration mission (North Oaks). Another first season mission! Used one threat which started in play. The game feels like it's still pretty up in the air after the latest overhaul a month or so ago.

## Roses

Having the opponents in the alliance mission increase the disposition if you work with them was pretty fun. Might be a cool idea there. The teamwork aspect of the game was a little more fleshed out and worked pretty well.

## Thorns

The undead from North Oaks would be more fun as a "group" that you can take out all in one swing. May want to have rules for gangs where extra successes go to wiping out lots of them. The ongoing tasks are too long, making the pacing feel pretty slow. That could be highlighting a deeper issue, though.

Broadly speaking, there were lots of areas that could stand to be either better integrated or improved.

# Areas to Watch

Lots of useful info and discussions from this playtest, but it further made me question what the game is really about. Clearly the core of it is still about growing characters and seeing them change and interact, as well as growing Red Bank. That's the most _fun_ part of the game. That hasn't changed since the beginning. It's also about defeating the Autarch and completing missions. But those are mostly _goals_, not so much _what you do_. It started out as a simple push your luck card game, but that's no longer true. The biggest issues currently revolve around the action economy. In order to solve them, it might be necessary to more unpack what the game is really about.

## Action Economy

Each character got one action (a test of some sort) and then the player gets an action (buying developments or trading, but usually passing). The player action isn't very interesting. It's probably better to just have characters do things, and turn buying developments and trading into character actions. Playing cards probably shouldn't be an action at all. Neither should completing a task when you have enough progress on it. That should probably be free. That would also streamline the flow a little bit. It would be: Movement, Actions, and Progress.

## Mission Success / Failure

The more I think about it, the more missions probably shouldn't be things you can completely _fail_. That is, just attempting the mission should unlock the critical things that make the campaign continue on. Instead, there may be bonus or stretch goals for missions that reward getting farther. That greatly simplifies tracking in the game. That is, you can't get X% through a mission and have to remember the state. And redoing missions isn't as much fun as just moving on. So, missions would have more of a scoring mechanic. That might not be as satisfying as a binary pass / fail, but I don't really know how to handle fail. It's only fun to redo a mission if there's some sort of tactical expertise that's gained. If it's mostly narrative, that doesn't exist.

## Trade

Trading is fun - but not used enough. Given that some of the tracks for various factions aren't improved until very late in the campaign, it's a lot of overhead for not much benefit. It would be better to have a general sort of trade action, and then have various benefits provided by factions later.

## Faction / Society Tracks

None of those are really used enough. Much of the feedback I've received is along the lines of "how does this come into play?" It needs to be more tightly integrated into the game. It's not really good if those tracks don't make an appearance until later. The legacy way to handle that is to reveal rules at a later time, which isn't totally bad. But there's probably a way to more tightly incorporate them.

# Game Structure

The big issue is to reflect on where choices are made, and what sort of choices are important. This feeds back into what the game is about. Is it a dice game? A deck building game? More of a worker placement game? A resource management game? This is an introspective period in the game's development.

Right now it's kind of a mish-mash of different mechanics. That's not necessarily bad, but it's important to cull mechanics that aren't getting used.

## Game Elements

There are the following elements in play: characters (skills, lifepath cards, discord cards, conditions), a mission (driven by a progress deck with timers), mission locations, spotlight locations, opponents, discord pool, resource dice (luxury, mana, timber, food, ore), alliance tracks (Sunriders, Burgan Vale, Gravewood, Lily Manor, Crescent Hold), society tracks (military, diplomacy, stability, espionage, sorcery, conquest), and development cards.

## Lesser Used Elements

Society tracks, alliance tracks, and resource dice aren't getting used enough. Resource dice tend to get rolled once and then used to buy developments. It would be better if more came out and they had a little more of a dynamic feel. It would also be nice if they could be used for more than just developments. Same with society tracks. How can they be used more? They should have a more important role in the game.

# Core Choices

Not sure how to unpack this, but I'd like to be a little more introspective about what the decision points of the game are, and how interesting those decisions are. There are a few choices that happen before the session: choosing the mission, assembling the party, choosing spotlight locations, and putting developments into different progress decks. Those are important choices, but I want to focus on the choices that happen more during play.

The game at the moment feels more like a dice game than a card game. You combine characters in different ways, and use their skills to overcome obstacles. There aren't really card combos that come into play much, but it could be something to think about going forward.

The choices are currently tied to the location cards. At the moment, they cycle the various currencies around and let you improve the state of things in various ways.

However, it's still the case that most of the things that happen are _reactive_ in the sense that they're triggered by symbols on the progress deck. The proactive choices are mostly dealing with various opponents that pop up.

## Ongoing Tests

As it stands, there's a tensions between moving along the mission, which mainly consists of doing various ongoing tests, and having events trigger via the progress deck. However, the ongoing tests aren't all that interesting. You basically just put characters on them, and they make progress. It's really linear and there aren't many _choices_ about which character does what. Maybe this isn't the best way to structure a mission? There is a mission deck that the players can move through, an encounter deck of random stuff, and then the spotlight locations. But all in all, it's very _reactive_.

The progress deck is handy to have in terms of triggering various cards as well as serving as a place to dump developments and character cards. But maybe the mission and encounter decks should be reworked? It might be better to have a set of mission locations that start in play, and then a mission deck, which has challenges, locations, events, and other stuff. Players can then pull from the mission deck as a character action?

## Proactive Missions

It won't change much if there are a set of locations in play and then a mission deck that players can draw from each turn. That makes it more direct, as opposed to having a progress deck with "draw mission card" triggers, but it's still true that the mission deck is mainly stuff being done to players, rather than much choice. It's a very linear romp through the mission.

### Multiple Mission Decks

Maybe it would be better to have some fixed decks of mission achievements, along with an encounter deck? So, there are different paths?

Like, "North Oaks - Necromancer's Lair 1", "North Oaks - Necromancer's Lair 2", "North Oaks - Deep Woods 1", "North Oaks - Deep Woods 2". Then you can progress through those as you wish. Although, without other cues, that choice looks pretty opaque. Maybe if the rewards on the mission link to those mini-quests, that might make it better? So you might not totally know what you're in for when you draw cards, but at least you could know the reward at the end. Not sure?

It does let players control the pacing more than a big encounter deck, though. You can try to churn through one path, or diversify.

Not sure what that would mean for quests. It's kind of setting up missions to already have sub-quests baked in.

### Mission Book

A similar idea is to have a mission book, a la _Tales of the Arabian Nights_, kind of go more the choose your own adventure route. Although, that's more a development concern. You can do very similar things with cards. Perhaps more complex branching is possible with a book, though. In that case, you might have a mission pamphlet for each mission rather than cards. The other downside: it's easier to have opponent cards, location cards, effect cards, etc, if you aren't using a book. You would have to mix and match a lot.

# Future Development

I'd like to try a big overhaul, with the following changes.

* No player actions. Trade, buying developments, etc, are driven by characters. That will give characters more to do and tighten up the action economy.
* General trade. Trade isn't driven by factions, rather it's a broad choice available at the beginning. Make it more viable early.
* No mission failure. Missions have "achievements" that you can gain by doing different things.
* Better integrate society and alliance tracks.
   * Not totally sure how to do this yet. At the very least, make sure those tracks are used in the missions in various ways.
* Multiple mission decks. Rather than one long slog, try breaking up the mission deck into parts, so you can complete one or the other or both.
* More dice manipulation.
   * It's nice if the dice can be manipulated to gain successes. It's also more interesting if the die can be used to do something, but the number on the die matters for other things. The way that trading works.

Finally, one part of the game that seems really important, but is getting a bit of a short shrift is the narrative arc of missions.#  Eastkeep / North Oaks Season One Playtest

Played through an infiltration mission (Eastkeep) and an exploration mission (North Oaks). Used one threat which started in play. There were some very interesting strategic decisions that emerged. But there were still some points that felt a little slow.

# Roses

Thought it was pretty fun to involve the resource game more. Could see doing even more of that.

# Thorns

The big ones: the faction disposition tracks and the society tracks could still be used more, the hindrance values didn't come into play enough. Also still not sure about mission pacing. It's better, but having multiple mission paths is pretty fiddly and doesn't really change things _that_ much.

## Involving Tracks More

This is probably the easiest to fix. These tracks should be used more in missions, on developments, and in starting locations. For example, instead of trading 3:1, could trade 3:disposition. Could use stability to remove conditions instead of a character condition, etc.

## Hindrance Not Used Enough

Tried something where the obstacles in the staging area don't apply their hindrance. That made it so they never really do. Instead, it might be good to have obstacles move to locations where characters are if they're activated.

## Player Season End

It might also be nice if one of the characters can perform actions at non-mission locations after they leave the mission. So they can do _something_. That's a little fiddly given that most of the cards won't apply, but it would keep a player in the game for a bit until the other player is done, performing more of a support role.

## Pacing / Encounter Deck

The pacing still felt a little off. Not sure having multiple missions paths really helps all that much. It does provide some choice, but there's quite a bit of overhead. Wondering about having one mission path you can complete, an encounter deck you can work through with random stuff, and then a miscellaneous goal. That still works within the framework fine. It would shift the choice to draw a card from the progress deck to just a draw.

Or maybe the player can draw as many encounter cards as they want? That doesn't seem like a good idea. It could really slow the game down.
