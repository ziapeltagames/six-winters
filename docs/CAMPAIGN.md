# The First Winter

Thea’s finger was hovering over a mark on the map when the doors to the Amber Lodge burst open. “Speaker, we found something that might interest you!”

Thea stopped and straightened. Fuscus tilted his head, eyeing the guards shoving forward two men. “Look what the cat dragged in. Imperials?”

One of the guards nodded. “We found these scouts coming in from the north.” The guards pushed the men to their knees, and the men made no move to resist. “We asked them why they were past Redbank borders, but they haven’t answered any questions so far.”

Menas stood from where he sat beside the table, the chair creaking in relief when his weight lifted, before he turned to face the scouts on the floor. “Not talking? Why?”

The guard sighed. “Not sure.”

Menas cracked his knuckles, making the two scouts jolt. “Do they want to lose their teeth that badly?

Thea glanced back at Keel. The boy’s feet were currently propped up on the table, stray mud from his shoe dotting the corner of the map. She ignored him for the time being and turned to the men. “Why were you crossing Red Bank’s borders? Was this an order or a mistake?”

One scout glanced up at her, before averting his eyes to the ground, a garbled mumble falling out of his mouth. Menas kicked him in the side with his boot. “Speak up.”

“Order...” he finally said.

Fuscus crossed his legs and leaned back in his chair. “Who’s order?” The man mumbled again, too quiet for them to hear. “I recommend you speak louder if you don’t want our thick-headed giant to kick your ribs in.”

Keel snorted suddenly before quickly looking away. Menas glared at Fuscus, but was forced to look back at the scout when he spoke again. “Autarch.”

Autarch? From that high up? Thea met Fuscus’s eyes, struggling to keep the alarm off of her face, before turning back to the men. “Why were you there?”

“She said look,” the other one mumbled. He shuddered, and Thea realized just how worn out he was. The guard was sweating like hell, as if he had run a mile, but his skin was pale as snow. Thea kneeled down beside him. He looked ready to throw up at any second, and she was about to call for a bucket when he spoke again. “Shouldn’t’ve. Shouldn’t’ve looked.”

“The Autarch must have been searching for something,” Fuscus mused.

“Take them out of here,” Thea ordered, standing. “Maybe get them some fresh water and a bed. And a bucket. Probably.”

The guards picked the men off the ground, but the men didn’t get on their own two feet, instead hanging limply while the guards hauled them out of the room. The doors closed behind them, the boom echoing in the grand hall.

Keel suddenly cleared his throat. “There’s nothing in northern Red Bank.”

“Not much, but not nothing,” Thea corrected.

Fuscus rested his finger at the top of the map. “Still, not much, which makes this easier.” He dragged his finger down, over the northern area of Red Bank, before landing on a tiny dot on the map. “Think that’s it?”

“North Oaks,” Thea read. “Could be. Or maybe Sightrock?”

“Nothing is in Sighrock. It must be North Oaks.” Menas slid a knife out of his belt, twirling it between his fingers with expert precision. “We’ll figure out what it is those scouts were looking for before the Empire can.”

“I dunno. They didn’t look so hot. Should we really be poking around up there?” Fuscus asked. He leaned his back against the table, watching Menas out of the corner of his eye as a sly smile crept across his face. “Rumors of the deathless? Think you can handle it?”

“We’re going,” Menas said through gritted teeth. “North Oaks. Now.” He twirled the knife one more time before stabbing it straight through the dot and into the table.

Fuscus leaped to his feet. “What the fuck mountain man? Do you realize how long it took to make that map?” He motioned at the knife, still quaking from where it stuck out of the table. “What’s your grudge against cartographers? Seriously!” He groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose. “It’s not like we can just head up there. There’s still the matter of the Sunriders. And Gravewood.”

“We’re not even going to figure out what the Autarch wanted? Eastkeep holds plenty of secrets,” Keel mumbled.

Menas glared at Fuscus, before standing up straight, turning to Thea. “Where first?”

# The Second Winter

# Whispers and Conspiracies

“Is everything packed?”

Fuscus looked up at Thea, who was standing above them, hands curled into fists and placed on her hips. “We leave bright and early in the morning. We have to be at Lily Manor by seven, sharp.” She huffed, blowing a stray strand of hair out from where it hung down her forehead. “They’re sticklers about that sort of thing.”

“They aren’t if they like you,” Fuscus said, arching an eyebrow. Thea glared at him, and he raised his hands in surrender. “Just mentioning, sweetheart. Just mentioning.”
Menas grunted his response. “They’re the spenders. Right?”

“They like their things, yes,” Fuscus said. And they really did. Lily Manor was known for its lavish mansions, grand feasts, and starving people.

Menas set his giant sword on the table, sending a cloud of dust rippling out over the wood, which would have been menacing if he hadn’t done it a million times already. He turned to glare at Keel. “Kid. Are you packed already?”

Keel nodded mutely, already returning to finicking with his crossbow without so much as looking up at Menas. He had his feet on the table, balancing himself on the back two legs of his chair. Menas seemed to mind Keel’s nonchalant attitude way more than anyone else. All Fuscus hoped for was that Keel wouldn’t fire off another crossbow bolt on accident. Fuscus’s poor, beautiful face. Nearly took his ear off.

Thea clapped her hands together. “Right. Well, that’s good. And, um, Oniri?”

Oniri stared at the tabletop with a blank expression. When Thea spoke, they looked up, but not quite at Thea, just a little to her left. Then they looked back down at the table.

Fuscus coughed, looking away. Fucking freak.

Oniri’s eyes darted to him, as if they had heard Fuscus’s thoughts, before trailing back over to Thea. “Who is the little boy.”

Thea blinked. “Pardon?”

“Boy. Little.” Oniri’s gaze dropped to Thea’s side, looking beyond her. “There. Right there.” They turned back to the table, their cloak falling low over their face and covering them in shadow. “Visitor.”

A loud fist banged on the door to the small cabin, making everyone jolt upright. Fuscus looked around, finding no one moving, before sighing and getting to his feet himself. “No, no, I’ll get it, I insist.”

He opened the door to the rainy weather outside. Immediately something sharp touched his throat.

He arched an eyebrow, looking up at the man holding a knife to his neck. “What can I help you with, sir?” Fuscus asked smoothly. He hasn’t even let go of the doorknob yet and there was already a blade to his throat. “Can we at least discuss it first, before you slice me open?”

“Fuscus? Who is it?” Thea called.

Fuscus tilted his head, ignoring the dig of the blade. “You tell me.”

The man in front of him was shaking, the tears in his eyes mixing with the rain pouring down his cheeks, and Fuscus could see the traces of blood around the sides of his face. “My son,” he gasped. “What the hell did you do to my little boy?”

Oniri sighed and drew small circles on the table with their finger. “Dead. Dead little boy.”

Fuscus stepped back into the cabin to allow the soaked man inside. The man walked in, although he was very hesitant, and stopped awkwardly just past the threshold. Goddammit, Fuscus couldn’t even close the door. The rain was going to get everywhere. He half wanted to push the door closed, force the man in or out, but the man was clearly in shock and forcing him to do anything would make it worse. Guess he just has to accept the rain.

Thea sucked in a breath. “Aisling? What happened?”

“Thea,” the man – Aisling, it seemed – whispered, stepping forward. Fuscus quickly shut the rain out while he was out of the way. “Why are you out here? With everything that has happened…”

“We’re going to Lily Manor tomorrow. What happened?” Thea asked. She pulled out the chair she would sit in, if she ever decided to sit down, and motioned Aisling towards it. 

“Your son? What happened to Castor?”

Aisling refused to sit down. Instead he pointed his blade towards their group, thankfully away from Fuscus’s throat this time. “That… thing.”

Oniri stopped tracing circles on the table and looked up at him. Aisling trembled, the hand holding the knife still trained on Oniri. “What did you do to him? You- you killed him. You killed him, didn’t you?!” He took a shaking step forward. “What the hell did you do?!”

“Woah, okay, Oniri has been with us this whole time,” Fuscus said. The knife was held to his throat again, and he sighed, moving the tip away with his finger. “Threatening us won’t do anything to help you. What happened? Explain, slowly.”

“He- he’s dead,” Aisling mumbled.

Fuscus arched an eyebrow. “Yeah. We got that.”

“He was killed by- by magic of some kind,” Aisling rambled. He yanked the knife back towards Oniri, gritting his teeth. “By some kind of curse. A curse you casted.”

“There are plenty of magic users in the world,” Keel said in his ever-quiet voice. “It’s not Oniri. They didn’t leave.”

“But people saw you, you… you… freak,” Aisling hissed.

Thea shook her head, glancing at Oniri. “Oniri’s been here. I can vouch for that. You trust me, right, Aisling?”

The knife lowered, only a little bit, and when Aisling spoke, his voice was thick. “Can I?” He glared at Oniri. “Lots of people said they saw you. They said ‘bone-patterned cloak’. I don’t know anyone else who has something like that.”

Oniri hummed. “Lying.” They traced shapes on the table again, not looking up still. “Not me.”

Thea bit her lip, her eyebrows pinching together with concern. “We’ll need to look into this. We’ll find out who did this to your son, but it wasn’t Oniri. Okay?”
“Look at them,” Aisling barked. “You can’t even consider that they could do more than we realize?”

“You’re going to need to leave,” Menas said.

“That thing can cast magic without even meaning to. You can’t even consider the possibility of them being in more than one place at a time?”

“You need to leave.”

“They killed him. They killed him, and we’re just going to let them get away with it?”

“Have it your way, then.” Menas got to his feet, the flooring creaking beneath his weight, his towering height blocking the light of the fire behind him. He marched over to 
Aisling, glaring at the man. Aisling dropped his knife out of fear. Menas promptly grabbed Aisling around the midsection, hoisting the man over his shoulder like a sack of potatoes and carrying him towards the door. He tossed Aisling out into the storm and shut the door behind him.

Thea collapsed into her chair, her head in her hands. “Castor… what…?”

Fuscus sighed, resting his hands on his hips. He needed a glass of wine, really. “It wasn’t Oniri. We can say that now. The only question is who did it.”

“The Autarch has magic,” Keel remarked off-handedly. “Think it’s her?”

Fuscus paused, considering. It makes sense. Burgen Veil is full of wizards, but they’re all too snobby about their arbitrary rules and regulations to really pull anything like this off. Murdering a little boy? Weird. Framing another magic user for it? Even weirder, and clearly premeditated. But… “Is the Autarch really that interested in Redbank? We haven’t made any moves against the Empire.”

“We haven’t even gone public with our plans,” Keel noted. He set his crossbow down, finally giving them his attention. “We’ve only talked with the council. And not even the full council.”

“You don’t think…” Thea swallowed, sitting up. “They’re listening. Keeping an ear on us.”

“Are you suggesting a spy?” Menas scoffed. “This is only one piece of information. It’s a big leap, from here to spy.”

“Is it? The Autarch likes an eye and an ear on everything. What better way to destroy a thieves’ den than to throw a bomb in the middle? Cause chaos to clear it out, basically the Autarch’s model.” Fuscus sat back down into his chair. It was strange, but not impossible.
Thea cleared her throat. “That settles it. I’m staying here. You guys go to Lily Manor without me.”

“What? No.” Fuscus crossed his arms over his chest, shaking his head. “No, I can’t handle these three without you there. There’s no point in diplomacy if we can’t put our best foot forward.”
