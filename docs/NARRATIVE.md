* Animaelic ForestTo-do: Add the correct flavor text and setup info for year one of six winters. Discuss first three available missions: Eastkeep, North Oaks, and Sunriders. Add clues to help players make initial choice.

Maybe have some choices for Red Bank that help configure different starting setup? Like various alliance tracks or society tracks.

For example, you can have a martial society and get X or a diplomatic society and get Y. Etc. Having some customizability early will help with player investment.

NOTE: The number of threats in the threat deck during each winter can be used to determine how bad things are. For example, if there are two or less threats, it's okay. If there are 3-4, -1 on a resource track, etc. That would punish the players for ignoring threats.

There might be opportunities to do similar things for the apotheosis track and secrets track. If it's at X, look at page Y and then more stuff happens, etc.To-do: Add the correct flavor text and info for year two of six winters. Discuss first next available missions. Add clues to help players make initial choice.
