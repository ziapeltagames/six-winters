# To-Do

* Add location or obstacle effects for burning or discarding obstacles

# Options

* Advantage system
   * Diplomacy: explore +1 new locations
   * Military: burn achievement of +1 difficulty at year end
* Deck tuning system
   * Burn 6 achievements at end of year (lowest stage first)
   * Burn 2 mission cards from each region at end of year (difficult <= year)
* Locations that get scorched by obstacles, leaving a special location card
   * Maybe units get played there, no matter what?
   * Or foes, etc. Kind of a magnet for certain units?
   * And those units are harder there, but the location can be burned?
* No cost obstacle defense via saving throw system
   * Approach: place matching dice on card up to skill
   * Defend: reroll rest of dice, check for stress
      * If skill >= difficulty, avoid stress on 1-3, otherwise avoid on 1
   * Overcome: place any remaining matching dice on obstacle

# 07/01/22

Overall, the playtest went pretty well. It seemed to tick some of the boxes: easier start, quicker play, easier initial achievements. Without the dice for starting/ending, it's much easier to finish achievements. Hardly any cards should have specific dice for begin/end, and really be careful about dice of a certain resource type. That made it possible to have only one progress card at a time.

The big next question, what if each player only runs one character? How does that feel in play? That would mean solo is probably 2 characters, and the rest of the configurations are one character per player.

## Streamlined Playtest Notes

* Darkness Unmasked didn't work with dimplomats
   * Not sure if it's a big deal, but maybe it should move a diplomat if there isn't one?
* Still not sold on insight for each region, diplomacy and military should maybe do other things
* May want to just have 12 cards per stage, or 15 for the last one
   * Having eight cards is going to favor some tracks, although wild cards are possibilities
* Maybe call achievements progress cards instead?
* Should praetorians do 2 body damage?
   * Activations should maybe do more damage - you see it coming
* Character card idea: move asset dice from one location to another
   * Could also be a location ability, move asset dice, that's really handy!
* How does teamwork go in this new world?
   * Each character probably needs to defend individually
   * Each character should improve skills if its overcome
   * The advances are taken when it's actually overcome, not per hit
* You should be able to use commitment cards as rerolls if desired

### Steamlined Playtest Year One

* Turn 1: Winter, Stage 0
   * 2 progress
   * 2 obstacles
* Turn 2: Spring, Stage 0
   * 3 progress (thanks to some lucky rolling and cards)
   * Keel took out an obstacle and leveled Thievery
   * 2 obstacles
* Turn 3: Spring, Stage 1
   * Had heavy rains this turn, but got to keep the extra turn
   * 2 progress
   * 3 obstacles
* Turn 4: Summer, Stage 1
   * 2 obstacles
* Turn 5: Fall, Stage 1
   * 2 progress
* Turn 6: Fall, Stage 2
   * Mostly about defending obstacles

Summary: Finished 9 total achievements, including 3 on espionage, but none on diplomacy. This feels about right. That's 9/6 overall progress, or about 1.5 for every track. Counterintuitively, may want it slightly _harder_ for military, sorcery, and tech.

Additionally, there were quite a few character advancements, maybe 3 or 4, which is also good. And six turns is probably about right. Felt quite a bit faster moving.

Threat track advancements are maybe a little low. But that's also the flow of the game: slower early, then quite a few obstacles coming out later.

Not sure about the "look ahead" advancements. They reveal an awful lot, given that's how threats work! Could be okay for one region, but maybe not for all three. Digging for locations may be a good diplomacy approach.

Maybe leave military with look ahead, but error on lots of military threats. That kind of fits thematically as well, and would lead to interesting end game states.

## Streamlined Achievement Trial Run

* Skills increase via difficult obs
* Commitment increases via stress (first two conditions?)
* Stages have
   * 0: 12 cards, draw 2
   * 1: 8 cards, draw 1
   * 2: 10 cards, draw 2
   * 3: 15 cards, draw 3
   * 4: 18 cards, draw 4
* Between 4 and 8 turns
   * If 1+ season icons, advance once
   * Otherwise advance to next season
* Five action dice
* One achievement at a time
   * Easier achievements on start/finish for stages 0 and 1
   * Burn 2 X Year random lowest stage achievements at end of year
   * 3 staged achievements
   * Ignoring dice on stage 1 achievements for begin/end of paths
* Burn most recent mission discard in each discard pile
   * Add new mission cards based on threats and shuffle
   * Throw burned mission cards on top
* Burn location
   * Draw 2 random locations at each region to replace

## Skill and Commitment Musing

Maybe character skills should relate to overcoming difficult obstacles? And commitment taking the first tier of stress? Then achievements are no longer achievements per se, but rather developments or production. Completely focused on resource tracks. That orients play towards obstacles even more. It probably quickens the pace of the game, as well, because character improvement is more of a side effect rather than a goal.

And because no dice are spent improving characters, that lowers the number of dice needed to make progress, most likely lowering the total number of dice needed per year. Potentially fewer turns are needed. Maybe five or six instead of eight?

There could be roughly 50 (five turns) to 80 (eight turns) dice in the two player game per year. Stage 0 take 3 dice, and Stage 1 take 5 dice, Stage 2 take 4, and Stages 3 and 4 are back to 3 dice. What if there are 12 achievements per stage? Two for each? You can do 1 at a time, and at game start you draw 3.

### Slow Play Scenario

* 4 staged achievements
* 1 at a time
* No discards during initial draw

Turn 1: Stage 0, Completed: 2, Draw: 6
Turn 2: Stage 1, Completed: 4, Draw: 3

You would need 14 cards to remain in stage 3 for 2 turns if you complete the max achievements. However, 2 of the stage 0 achievements would be in the draw pile, which could be useful.

What if there were 8 cards in the deck? If you burned 4 of them? In that case, basically no matter how slow you play it, you're out of stage 0 after turn 1. Also with 12 cards, you have to stay in stage 0 for at least a turn if there are only 3 discards. If there are 4 discards, you can get out immediately.

About 12 cards per stage isn't bad if there are three staged achievements.

## Achievements Revisited

The one active achievement per player is more feasible if the first and last slots aren't very restrictive (they aren't fixed numbers of a certain resource type). Colors are significantly easier, as are regional. Next is numbers, which can be tricky earlier, and finally is fixed, which are very hard. Fixed numbers should probably be shortcuts.

Number of Dice: 3 / 4 / 5 / 4 / 3
Number of Draws: 2 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 2
Number of Cards: 12 / 9 / 12 / 15 / 6

## Game End

The idea of a special location that comes out when the sorcery threats are maxed is interesting, but it begs the question: should all threat tracks do something along those lines? This kind of gets at what scoring/endgame should be like.

There are three tracks for winning.

* Pyrrhic victory: one track is maxed out, with advantage
* Major victory: two tracks maxed out, with advantage
* Total victory: all tracks maxed out, with advantage

Maybe each track has a few fictional endings, with certain questions to ask, based on disadvantage, advantage, or victory. And then you can score points totals:

* For each victory track: +3
* For each track maxed out: +2
* For each track with advantage: +1

For a points total of 0 (loss) - 15 (dominant victory).

Given that, should probably have a way to lower threats if they do get maxed out? Otherwise a kind of pointless end game could shape up.

## Peak Threats

* Sorcery: Animaelic Forest Location + Mind of the Autarch

## Obstacle and Threat Track Effects

If a card burns a location, what should cause that to happen? Probably military or maybe sorcery. Another option is an Oniri discord effect.

Or maybe the peak threat tracks aren't obstacles at all, but rather special locations that come into play? After all, they would probably be fairly difficult to draw normally at the very end of the campaign.

### Peak Threat Locations

* Sorcery: Animaelic Forest
* Military: Some Kind of Apocalyptic Battlefield
* Espionage: Autarch's Throne?

What would those do? If XYZ, you lose? Such as:

Animaelic Forest: "Move xxSORCERY obstacle to this location", "If there are 2+ xxSORCERY obstacles, auto lose?"

Or is it a way to win?

Such as, "Spend XYZ to advance xxSORCERY track?"

Something like that shouldn't undermine the campaign to that point. If it suddenly becomes an "auto win/lose", that's kind of tricky. Maybe it provides a way to lower the threat track? That might be okay. So players still need to raise the sorcery track, but it lets them reclaim the advantage.

Perhaps there's an obstacle card attached to the location, and overcoming it lets you lower the threat track by some amount? That's not a bad pattern. Maybe it lowers it by XYZ and then is burned. It allows players a method to "catch up" if a track gets pegged.

## Mission Card Brainstorming

* Try taking 2 cards per season, that's 10 cards in each deck for the entire game
* Would need more starting cards, perhaps 15 or more

* Base cards: 45
* Advance cards: 25
* Location cards: 10
* Total mission cards: 80

An initial goal of 9 symbols per threat seems close to correct, 6x9 = 54 total threat tags (9 cards would have double or more symbols). That gives about a 20% probability of drawing any given symbol, and about 1% of drawing three in a row.

* Starting Difficulties
   * 1 1 1 1 1
   * 2 2 2 2
   * 3 3 3
   * 4 4
   * 5

### Threats

* Empire (Espionage, Technology)
   * Espionage: 5
   * Technology: 4
   * Military: 4
   * Sorcery: 3
   * Diplomacy: 1
   * Support: 1
* Red Bank (Support, Technology)
   * Support: 6
   * Technology: 4
   * Sorcery: 3
   * Military: 2
   * Diplomacy: 2
   * Espionage: 1
* Settled (Diplomacy, )
   * Diplomacy: 6
   * Espionage: 3

   * Support: 2
   * Technology: 1

# 06/14/22

## Mission Card Brainstorming

* At the end of each year, burn X cards in each region, less than or equal to current year
* Maybe just one card per region, since only about 1 will be added, maybe even less

Y1: 1111222334 (10 starting, 2/year = 0 at the end)
Y2: 11222334
Y3: 112334
Y4: 1124
Y5: 11
Y6: -

Need at least 3 of each threat type for the entire campaign. 12 per region means 36 starting mission cards. With that, could have 6 or so of each threat, with some multi-threat tags.

12 cards per region:

111
222
333
44
5

If you have those 12 cards per region, taking the highest available each year would leave:

111
22
3
4

Could incentivize taking lower cards, though, by having winter tags, or more common threat tags.

The other implication: maybe shouldn't have locations with starting cards that are more "generic", such as guards, units, etc. All location cards should maybe be special an unlocked later?

# 06/11/22

## New Achievement Structure

Need to refactor the two player achievements again.

* Stage 0 (15 cards) - draw 2 cards
* Stage 1 (17 cards) - draw 1 card
* Stage 2 (15 cards) - draw 2 cards
* Stage 3 (15 cards) - draw 3 cards
* Stage 4 (6 cards) - draw 4 cards

How many achievements are desired at the end of the campaign? Should players immediately start in stage 2? Maybe there are 7 or so stage 1 achievements left? Then you can work backwards? Need to burn 25 cards, so 5 each mission. Which means there will be 3 years of stage 0 cards. Thus, a number of tracks will have 3 advances or so.

Stage 1 achievements are 5 dice for resources and 4 dice for skills. Maybe stage 0 are 3 dice for resources and 2 dice for skills? Perhaps easy ones at that?

## No Cost Defense

Another option is to have a fixed target number (say <= 3) for skilled defense and a different target number (1) for unskilled defense.

# 06/09/22


### Possible Advantage Mechanics

Other options:

* Explore for new locations (look at 3 instead of 2), diplomacy?
* Some kind of special action slot
* Burn 1 fewer achievement at end of year (burn 5 instead of 6), military?

Probably not:

* Movement benefits (this overlaps w/locations and character cards, probably not great)

## Unlocking Mission Cards

Should the mission cards be 1:1 based on the different threat tracks? That's probably the easiest. It's also probably nice if the threats don't match exactly, although... that would make it easier to track. Could have numbers on the cards, matching the threat tracks.

That's a death spiral, though. Although, players will know the disposition of those cards works that way. Should probably have a core of base cards of each threat type.

### Starting Obstacles

4 x 6 Threats = 18

### Advanced Obstacles

3 x 6 Threats = 18 obstacles

Technology: 2, 3, 4
Espionage: 2, 3, 4, 5
Military: 2, 3, 4
Diplomacy: 2, 3, 4, 5
Support: 3, 4, 5
Sorcery: 2, 3, 4, 5

## Win Conditions

As it stands, the game is really one long game, not a game you play six times. You progress to and end point.

Is there enough tension in this approach? Even though adding a per point win condition doesn't change much in terms of the campaign arc, it can make each game feel like it has a focus.

Still thinking of tabling this for now.

## Early Game

It would probably be good to have a quicker and simplified early game. Make it possible to grab achievements fairly quickly. And have fairly spare starting locations in terms of location effects. Let those come later.

* Achievements are simple: perhaps just different resource dice of any type
* Minimal location effects/triggers
* Minimal obstacle exposure (minimal chance of threats)

How do you transition from these more simplistic achievements to more complex achievements?

Is there a reimagining of achievements that can solve this? Maybe the difficulty of improving a resource is based on how far along it is? That doesn't really work with pacing.

* Stage S (Years 1-2)
* Stage 1
* Stage 2
* Stage 3
* Stage 4

Can you mix the more simplistic achievements with the more complex ones? On one card?

### Special Year One Deck

This is a simple path forward. But not having stages goes against some parts of the game.

### Special Stage Zero

This could be a set of cards that are particularly easy. Similar to stage 1 cards, they could get burned. This feels a little better in some ways? Although the big question: how do these stages get burned over time. Don't want them hanging around too long.

* Stage 0
* Stage 1
* Stage 2
* Stage 3
* Stage 4

How could those be burned?

* Resource level
   * This seems like the best option overall
   * Maybe if it's used to reach a certain level, you burn it
* Threat level
   * This seems pretty bad: couldn't catch up, and is very much a death spiral
* Game turn
   * Fine, but somewhat lacking in strategy
   * Actually, players can choose which to burn - that would preserve strategy
* Something with characters
* Something with locations
   * That probably gives locations too much influence

It probably makes more sense for it to be resource level, otherwise you just can't catch up. Maybe there's something that burns the card if it's used for XYZ. Like 2+: Burn. Or like 3+.

Should Stage 0 cards have obstacle draws on them? Probably should at least have one, or that's really, really slow. May need to have the stage number separate from the stars?

## World Growth

There are a few possibilities to make imperial advancement impact the growth of the world: mission deck construction, encoded effects on obstacles, location choices, encoded effects on locations, achievement deck construction, achievement difficulties.

### Mission Deck Construction

This approach is more fiddly than what's there, but it's fiddly during end of game teardown, so it's not super difficult. It's also fairly intuitive. The one thing needed, though, is the ability to burn obstacles. Otherwise the deck would get more and more diluted.

One idea is to burn discards that match the resource of the burned location in that region. However, that doesn't make a ton of sense thematically. If anything, there should be more obstacles matching the burned location, since it's overrun.

It also could be the case that no discards are burned some games. After all, it may not match any of them. Another option is to allow players to burn any of the cards.

### Obstacle Effects

There's not much space on obstacles for things like "If advantage, XYZ". And it's difficult to conceive of lots of advantage effects, when there are already lots of effects on obstacles. First reaction is this is perhaps an even more fiddly approach, even though the deck manipulation is easier.

The one way this is perhaps easier is if obstacles all have a standard advantage effect, such as stress. For instance, if Red Bank is at a disadvantage, stress does XYZ. Or difficulty does XYZ. This is a bit of a death spiral - although, character skills overcome cards, so that's a bit easier. Difficulty frequently means more dice, though, which can mess up an action economy. Stress is probably the best option.

Maybe advantage doubles stress. That's a somewhat easy option.

### Location Card Effects

Location cards are easier to encode advantage effects on, since they frequently don't have as much going on. Although this is more flavor than a unified approach.

### Location Card Choices

A stronger approach is to unlock or place certain location cards when the tracks reach certain points. Forcing players to take certain locations is a little clunky, though. There would be tension between cool locations that get unlocked and "bad" locations players are forced to take. It's also kind of nice to have some randomness from locations, which reinforces a sandbox approach.

It could be that locations get unlocked as players move up tracks. That's certainly possible, and reinforces stuff happening. Although, some number of locations need to be in the base options.

### Analysis

The two best options for increasing the importance of threat tracks are Obstacle Stress or Obstacle Deck Construction.

Obstacle stress is certainly easier, but it's not exactly a rich set of options. It also introduces a lookup step during overcome obstacles, which is clunky. Mission deck construction is probably the best approach. It's fiddly, but it's during a fiddly deck construction process. And once the decks are built, it's forgotten about. It also includes the option to introduce some really gnarly cards. The big issue with it, is deck dilution. Is that a concern? Do you need to burn cards somehow?

## Burning Obstacles

If cards get added to decks, some cards should probably be burned, so the deck dilution isn't too bad. But how?

* Some cards get burned when overcome. This has the benefit of higher control. It also is already in the game, via character unlocks. But some particularly bad stuff could be one time. This may be the best option.
* End of game burns. Probably focusing on discards, since they are already in play.
* Location effects could target cards in the discard.

Thinking about it more, encoding burn results on obstacles is probably the best path forward. Additionally, location effects could burn cards in discard piles, giving players a little ability to tune different decks.

## More Obstacle Stress Musing

Another option for overcoming obstacles:

* Defend
   * If any dice in the pool are <= character skill or 1, no stress
* Attack
   * Set aside dice <= skill and reroll the rest
   * Place any matching dice on obstacle

Blah. Actually, this is no good. Players can just hold a defense die. A no spend defense is possible, but you _have_ to roll the defense dice.

* Split attack/defense dice
* Reroll defense, check for stress
* Apply any matching attack dice to card

What's there may actually be cleaner in many ways. You'd really need the following:

* Approach: place matching dice on card up to skill
* Defend: reroll rest of dice, check for stress (<= skill or 1)
* Overcome: place any remaining matching dice on obstacle

# 06/08/22

## Playtest Notes

* Achievements are hard
  * Be very careful about starting and ending places
* Mission cards have a single stage of insight to them
  * Manipulating mission card deck
  * Locations can manipulate deck
* Permanent changes to a deck are probably at fixed points

## Resource Advantage Effects

* Diplomacy: look ahead at next settled lands obstacle
* Military: look ahead at next red bank obstacle
* Espionage: look ahead at next imperial obstacle
* Support: invest all matching dice of a resource type
* Technology: +1 action die
* Sorcery: use sorcery dice as achievement wild card

Other options:

* Digging for certain locations (exploration)
* Movement benefits
   * Although, these are also on locations, so that's a doubled up effect, and kind of hard to remember
* Some kind of special action slot?
* Something with achievements?

## Empire Advantage Effects

* Some obstacles could have additional

## Empire Fixed Track Effects

* Unlock different obstacles, add them to the deck
* Unlock different locations, put into play (maybe even easier than obstacles)

## Campaign Thoughts

Single games have interesting choices, but the overall campaign framework feels thin.

In particular, the threat difficulties and the resource levels don't feel super well integrated into the evolving narrative. It seems like, as those tracks change, they should really

* Resource tracks: The Empire tracks are all very binary win/loss signifiers
   * Would perhaps be more interesting if the track state was reflected in other cards: locations, obstacles, achievements, characters
* Locations: what sort of thematic impact should swapping out locations have?
* Obstacles: These are also fairly static

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Could introduce advantage (RB > Empire) and disadvantage (Empire > RB) for resource tracks. That could impact locations, obstacles, and even achievements.

What are some examples of advantage and disadvantage?

* May only play a certain location if RB has advantage
* If RB has disadvantage, obstacle does more stress

## Obstacle Decks

Another alternative to modifying cards in play, is to construct the decks based on current tracks. This is similar to possibilities for locations.

Or, perhaps, locations determine obstacle cards, and tracks determine locations.

But how do cards get removed from decks?

## Achievements

Could have achievements increase in difficulty as empire tracks improve?

## Locations

Having locations change over time is interesting, but they should perhaps be closer tied to a growing framework.

* Can burned locations impact the game somehow?

The easiest way is for burned locations to increase imperial tracks, although that's a little dangerous, since obstacles do that.

## Unlocking Locations

Another option is to have locations become unlocked based on resource levels. This is much less of a sandbox, but it would make the resource tracks matter quite a bit more. Perhaps very low resource tracks unlock fairly garbage locations.

For instance, tech improvement could unlock certain tech locations?

## Obstacle Difficulties

It would be nice if the obstacles scaled along the same tracks as the resources. Currently, it's really not worth having a skill of more than about 2 for obstacles. However, 3 or even 4 can be useful for resources.

Is there a way to tie obstacle difficulties back into advantage or disadvantage?

Could somehow tie it back to stress?

* Stress = Empire Difficulty - Character Skill
   * Would have to have a "minimum of 1" for this approach, obstacle method doesn't work with 0 stress
* Stress = Double if Empire Difficulty > Character Skill
   * This is a little bit easier to calculate, since there's only a comparison
   * For this approach, would need to lower stress amounts, most likely, into the 1-3 range

## Obstacle Stress

Another option for skill vs. difficulty is the number of dice needed to avoid stress. If skill > difficulty, you only need to spend 1 die. Otherwise you need to spend 2 dice. Although, it'd be a little better if you don't spend any dice for stress, rather, it's a function of attack or skill somehow.

Honestly, may be interesting and easiest to just have every obstacle be either 1 or 2 stress to engage no matter what? That's probably too clamped down, not enough uncertainty.

What if the pattern for obstacles is a little different:

* Lock dice
* Reroll others
* Attack with as many as possible
* Check for damage/stress
* Discard obstacle

That doesn't really change anything. The issue with this pattern is that players can lock down certain defense dice. What if attack and defend are different pools, and you always reroll defend?

Maybe you roll < skill, and that's a successful defend? That could make skills all the way up to 6 matter.

* Set aside action dice up to skill
* Make defense test with remaining dice
   * If any dice <= character skill in pool, take no stress
* Place any dice onto obstacle, check if overcome

Not spending to defend is kind of nice. It would certainly showcase skill improvement. By not spending to defend, could have 2 or 3 dice on obstacles more frequently.

## Solo Campaign Year One Write-Up

Playing through a solo campaign of _Six Winters_: a mix of _Oath_, _Dicey Dungeons_, _Wrath of the Autarch_, and _Noctiluca_.

Recently I got the game into _Tabletop Simulator_, which took some effort, but there have been benefits: quicker iteration cycles, remote play, and easier save/load. I haven't done any scripting yet.

The goal of the game is to stop the Empire from dismantling your society (Red Bank), which you do via a combination of Diplomacy, Espionage, and local Support. You play the game up to six times, where each session lasts a year of game time (and a little less than 3 hours of real time).

There are a rotating cast of characters you can select from each game, each with unique abilities (that mostly manifest mechanically as dice manipulation chains). You can have variable numbers of players for each session.

If any of this looks interesting, and you own TTS, I'd love some more experienced eyes on it and I'm more than happy to facilitate a game. At some point I'm hoping to finish the official rules and get it into the TTS workshop.

The last time I attempted a solo game, the characters got in bad shape fairly quickly, and it looked so bad by year three that I abandoned the attempt. Anyway, I made some tweaks to cards, so hopefully this time goes a little better!

*Setup*

In solo mode, you select two characters, although you only have one pool of action dice from which to spend to do things. I chose Thea (Speaker for the East) and Fuscus (Master of Coin), who can play off of each other fairly well, and will handle rapport and command obstacles, although I'll be very weak in combat.

I decided to go with the standard starting locations instead of drawing randomly. It's a bit easier and there are a diverse set of options.

The opening achievements draw was okay, not great, not terrible. Completing achievements is how you win as well as how you can improve your characters over the campaign. I selected a diplomacy (a win condition) and thievery (a character skill) achievement. I'm going to need a little luck to make good progress on the diplomacy achievement right away.

*Winter (Year Start)*

Would like to get rid of the Hogel obstacle card. He's an asshole, and will mess up any asset dice I create. Also would like to make progress on the diplomacy achievement. And I'm nervous about really bad weather coming in the spring (two spring symbols showing on the mission decks). Thankfully I drew a card that lets Thea manipulate the staged achievements, which affects those symbols.

Got very lucky playing some cards for rerolls, as well as dealing with Hogel. One dice away from completing both achievements. Also managed to dodge really bad spring weather thanks to Thea.

*Spring*

Managed to knock out the diplomacy and thievery achievements, as well as a military achievement. The obstacle situation is starting to look bad - unfortunately drew some military units, which neither Thea or Fuscus are very strong at. Started work on a tactics achievement to shore that up some.

Still, things are looking pretty good for year one. A little nervous about the pacing for achievements. The better achievements are deeper in the deck, but more obstacles will come out as well. May need to slow play the summer a bit, and knock out some obstacles, instead of blaze through achievements.

However, I'd really like that tactics achievement to deal with the obstacles!

*Summer*

Summer brought with it a heat wave. Haven't done very well with seasonal events. Still, stress is pretty good (so far), but when I engage with these military units, some characters are going to get beat up.

Somewhat amazingly, none of the bad obstacles have activated, but my luck is going to run out at some point.

The prolonged heat wave ate into Fuscus's weak constitution. His psyche and body tracks already have condition checks - will probably need some R&R during Year Two.

Bumped up the support track in late summer, but also did push into the stage two achievements, narrowly missing military threats. Thea got beat up leading a battle against some imperial praetorians, but it was certainly worth it.

*Fall*

Going to be tight down the home stretch. Would love to snag maybe one of the better achievements, but that will be tough given how many obstacles are going to be coming out now. Could also sacrifice strategic positioning for longer term gain. Maybe worth just pushing my luck and hoping there aren't any threats.

Went after achievements instead of dealing with obstacles - and got very unlucky. Lots of support threats came out, which the Empire exploited to progress towards victory. Need to attack these obstacles, even if it means ignoring achievements.

*Winter (Year End)*

Thea got extremely taxed dealing with support threats - and still unfortunately had another support threat due to very unlikely imperial obstacle draw. Gathering support at home is going to be a huge hurdle the rest of the campaign, going to have to be very sensitive to those threats going forward.

*Year End*

Managed to snag a final boost on resource tracks - but at a pretty significant cost. The Empire is really far along the support track. Only five advances the rest of the way, or our society collapses from within. Boo.

Also, Thea and Fuscus both got fairly beat up for not a ton of advances. The positives were multiple bumps on the sorcery and diplomacy tracks. Looking like maybe a race to rally support from allies before Red Bank collapses.

The praetorians also moved into Undari's Tower, and it fell. Having imperial military in the Red Bank deck is very much not ideal going forward. And they'll go right on top. Blah. Hogel Manor is off limits because of a spider wizard. Also not great.

New locations: Undari's Tomb, Prominence, and Goldspike. That will open up a port between The Empire and the Settled Lands, which is very useful! Undari's Tomb is rough, the necromancer is particularly difficult. However, defeating the necromancer unlocks a new character: Oniri, a fairly powerful mage.

Things don't look great, but they're also not hopeless just yet.

## Solo Campaign Playtest Thoughts

What should character skill max be? Somewhere between four and six? Anything above a four is kind of a waste when it comes to obstacles.

## Obstacles and Skill Tests

It would be nice if higher skills mattered more for obstacles. They do some, but not much. Keeping dice is useful, because it allows for more flexibility. Difficulties are okay for that, but it's kind of fiddly for not much benefit. 

# 05/27/22

## Solo Campaign

Solo playtest notes. Going through a campaign mode for full solo.

Optional choices:

* Going with standard starting locations
* Using full mission decks
   * Not bound by location cards
* Not going to burn mission cards
* Using standard starting positions on tracks
   * Could use random starting, or special rapid Year 1

## Year One

* Draw four achievements (two extra)

# 05/24/22

## Campaign Options - Locations and Mission Cards

* Could create regional mission decks based on locations coming into play. It makes the decks more predictable and gives the locations more influence.

# 05/07/22

## Playtest Notes

* Tome of Forking Paths - needs to be changed, not as good / dig X cards

## Seasonal Events

The seasonal events cards are okay, but aren't maybe useful enough to strive toward. Some things with events:

* Ideally, should be "one and done", it's easy to forget things like +/- movement, etc
* Could operate on stress, resources, action dice
* Maybe +1 / -1 action dice is a better way to handle things

* Place resource dice on urban, rural, wilderness, eldritch
* +1 action die
* -1 action die
* +1 character card
* -1 character card
* Discard unit, foe, diplomat, issue
* Draw card
* Take stress if in urban, rural, wilderness, eldritch
3
## Seasonal Event Effects

* Do not refresh resource pool

### Winter

* Each player has -1 action die during refresh step.
* All characters in wilderness locations take 1xxBODY.
* All characters in rural or wilderness locations take 2xxBODY.
* Discard one unit.

### Spring

* Each player has +1 action die during refresh step.
* All characters in eldritch locations take 2xxPSYCHE.
* Add xxSORCERY die to each eldritch location.

### Summer

* Each player may immediately move one of their characters to a different location.
* All characters in urban locations take 1xxBODY.
* Discard one diplomat or issue.
* Add xxTECHNOLOGY die to each urban location.

### Fall

* Add xxSTABILITY die to each location in xxREDBANK.
* Do not refresh the xxSTABILITY pool this turn.

## Playtest Results

Most of the streamlined versions, from one achievement to not using skills, didn't work very well. They sacrificed too many interesting choices and didn't make the game all that much quicker in practice. One option for streamlining is to only have one path on each achievement, but still work on two at once. The widely varying paths are a huge cognitive lift for maybe not much gain.

# 04/13/22

## Next Single Player Playtest

* Try six skill version
* Obstacles are placed as normal
* Seven action dice
* Use matching investments variant

## One Player Playtest Notes

* Having obstacles come out every other turn is closer to the right pacing, but it's also more erratic. Having one come out every turn is a brutal pace, though. One option is to have more dice available.
* Still unsure of 8 vs. 6 skills, so many pros and cons
* The discord cards probably shouldn't cause stress
   * There's already a mechanism for causing stress, and discord cards result from that
   * It's nice if discord cards also have an immediate effect, and stress+stress is not fun
* Not sure about multiple paths for achievements
   * There are already two achievements in play, so there are multiple paths
   * Lots of cognitive overhead in an already complex game
* Still not sure about trade
   * Probably should work the same as invest, but should it be out only?
   * If it's out only, that's extremely limiting

## Six Skills

* More streamlined
* Fewer skill achievement cards
* Some confusing symbology to sort out - skill vs. resource
* Using assets could be confusing, as assets are also typed
* Some obstacles would have to be rethought
* Potential looking forward to WotA 2.0

Probably the biggest limitation is the effect on obstacles. All diplomats would threaten diplomacy, all units would threaten military, etc. Couldn't have diplomats who threaten military. Technology is a tough one to come up with threats for. What's a tech threat that's overcome using tech? Traps, devices, war machines?

And creatures aren't really possible threats anymore, because they don't fit on the Empire vs. Red Bank axis. They probably threaten support, but why would they be overcome with support?

* Technology: traps, devices, war machines
* Support: mobs, creatures, issues - creatures are extremely tenuous, they'd probably fall into sorcery
* Sorcery: creatures, magical effects

Another option is to remove some skills, such as maybe survival and disguise. Would still have a tighter set of skills.

# 03/29/22

## Streamlining and Shortening Time

* Six skills, matching resources
* No more obstacle difficulties (just use skills)

These two options would streamline the game quite a bit. Not sure if it would lose its charm or not. But it would lower the handling time. At that point, location cards could probably be drawn blind if desired. The only tricky part is unlocking a new character, which is pointless in year six.

* Fewer turns
* Fewer dice
* Fewer characters

Out of these options, fewer turns will have the biggest impact on game length. However, the pacing gets tricky with fewer turns. Drawing obstacles at the end of each turn is fun - and with six turns, there isn't much time for mounting tension. There wouldn't be as much "build up". Just a few turns, and then it would need to ramp up.

# 03/15/22

## Mission Card/Location Card Ideas

* Move stability card
* Move cards of XYZ type
* Move to port

# 03/14/22

## Mission Deck Analysis

* How should cards be burned?
* No choices
   * In this version, some cards are burned, and some aren't
   * There's not as much choice here
   * Most of the burned cards are probably "misc" sorts of cards, and more special events
   * Burned cards: necromancer, one off events, etc
* Some choices
   * Really, this is only relevant for a few cards, like The Necromancer
* All choices
   * Are these choices interesting?
   * Early on these choices will be pretty opaque
   * What should be burned?
   * What should be kept?
   * This seems like a lot of overhead for not much interest

## Character Deck Analysis

* Should Thea and Menas have "sacrifice" cards?
   * Take conditions to discard some kind of obstacle?
   * Menas could take conditions to burn an obstacle?
* Menas - murder card is a discord 5
   * Menas burns military for body conditions
* Fuscus takes out diplomacy threats for stability track bumps
* Lucia maybe dies, but takes out Master of Secrets
* Keel maybe doesn't have that bad of 5s

## To-do

* Achievement overhaul
   * Tweak locations slightly, focusing on diplo/esp early
   * Take a look at frequency of locations, diplo seems a little high overall
* Mission card overhaul
   * Make sure dice align with cards / characters
   * Adapt season and burn/discard to long term frequencies
   * Empire: Grow Fall and Espionage, moving out Spring and Military to RB, burning others
   * Settled: Grow Spring and Diplomacy, moving out Fall and Sorcery to RB, burning others
   * Red Bank: Flat - burning good cards slowly over time
   * All: Grow winter
* Location overhaul
   * Should probably lower move requirements on some cards
* Character card overhaul
   * Think about discord 5 cards - should have some benefits / lots of characterization

# 03/12/22

# Card Placement

Starts along main resource axis, then coalesces around Red Bank during the late game.

Empire: Military cards are mostly Spring, moving out into Red Bank. Spring cards can get burned or move (Drift into Summer/Fall)
Red Bank: Fall cards can get burned or move. (Drift into Spring/Summer)
Settled: Summer cards can get burned or move. (Drift into Spring/Fall)

Stage 1 (17 cards, 3 commitment)

2 1 3
2 1 2
3 1 2

Stage 2 (16 cards, 2 commitment)

2 2 2
2 1 2
2 1 2

Stage 3 (15 cards, 1 commitment, multi-cards)

2 3 2
1 2 1
1 2 1

Stage 4 (12 cards, No Skills or Commitment, double resources)

1 2 1
1 2 1
1 2 1

## Mission Card Ideas

* Attack ports (administerial)
* Attack resource dice
* Burn some cards (no choice)
   * Late game has more winter?
* Should winter cards be harder, and unable to be burned?
   * Then they could wind up on top of the deck after destroying a location
* Units should be spring cards?
   * Help targeting Red Bank's military center?
* Probably want Red Bank: Spring, Settled: Summer, and Empire: Fall
* Cards to burn/move
   * Empire: Military cards are mostly Spring, moving out into Red Bank. Spring cards can get burned or move (Drift into Summer/Fall)
   * Red Bank: Fall cards can get burned or move. (Drift into Spring/Summer)
   * Settled: Summer cards can get burned or move. (Drift into Spring/Fall)

# 03/10/22

## Mission Card Difficulties

May map the numbers to characters and types of obstacles.

* 1 - Tech/traps
* 2 - Espionage/guards
* 3 - Military/units
* 4 - Diplomacy/diplomats
* 5 - Support/stability/issues
* 6 - Sorcery/magic

That will inform what die types the characters get. Right now there's a mismatch for Thea and Menas if this schema is used, but otherwise it maps pretty close. Also, maybe there's a trade-in/trade-out for characters instead of reroll cards? For instance, Thea could have 4->5.

# 03/06/22

## Sandbox Mode Playtest

* Start all Empire tracks at 4
* Start all RB tracks at 3
* Victory is determined at end of year 6
* Victory: Get Espionage or Diplomacy to 6, and 2 other tracks higher
  * Points: total up difference between RB and Empire tracks, multiply by difficulty
* Auto fail: any Empire track is maxed out

### Sandbox Setup

* Start with locations: draw 5 randomly for each region
   * These are unlocked
   * Choose 1/each
   * Dig through decks to find any starting attachments
* Shuffle mission decks

### Per Session Setup

* Place locs and obs out from before
* Shuffle diffculty 1 achievements
   * Draw 6, each player chooses 2
   * Place other 2 in lowest achievement stage slots
   * Fill out other staged achievement slots
* Choose characters

### End of Session Teardown

* Burn 1 loc in each region
   * Region must have the most obs / tied for most obs
   * Place any attached obs at bottom of region mission draw deck
* Unlock 3 locs in year 2 and 3 locs in year 3
   * Choose new locs to go into empty slots
   * If they have starting obs , look in discard piles first, then main decks from bottom up
* Shuffle mission discards
   * Place under top 3 cards from mission draw pile
* Put away cards, keeping locs and obs straight

## Open Questions

* How do obs move around? Should they? Is it difficult for activation? Movement phase?
* How is the distribution of threats, skills, and effects for mission cards?
* How useful/interesting are the weather effects?
* How much achievement deck manipulation should character cards have? 
* What about moving obs via character cards? Or having bonus actions on reroll character cards?

## Location Attachments

What happens if an attachment isn't in the listed deck? How do you find it? Do you search everywhere? Do you search all decks until you find one?
# 02/28/22

## Weather Tables

Winter

* 0 - Clear Weather
* 1 - Brutal Cold
* 2 - Flurries
* 3 - Blizzard

Spring

* 0 - Mild and Pleasant
* 1 - Clear Weather
* 2 - Heavy Rains
* 3 - Flooding

Summer

* 0 - Mild and Pleasant
* 1 - Clear Weather
* 2 - Heat Wave
* 3 - Drought

Fall

* 0 - Bountiful Harvest
* 1 - Clear Weather
* 2 - Heavy Rains
* 3 - Flurries

## Achievements Idea

Could have motivation as a box on existing achievements. Would promote building into corners. Could also have things like discard, draw, or other effects as part of an achievement. Have to be careful with discard, though, because don't want to subvert the obstacle game. But motivation could easily work as a build out on cards rather than its own card.

# 02/24/22

Done:

* Redo the stability track as "support"
* Add a stage track to the main board
* Put threat determination after the encounter draw
   * Make it 3+, which means it's not sudden
   * Get rid of the 3+ max at a location issue (shouldn't be as big of a problem now)
* Make all tracks races
   * RB starts on 1-3
   * Empire starts on 4-6
* RB auto-win: Diplo or Espionage
* Empire auto-win: Military or Sorcery
* Year 6: RB win if 4+ tracks are higher

# 02/22/22

To-do:

* Add back in wide variety of threat tags
   * Check out how they look on git
* Make the advanced obstacles region neutral
* Add region tags for the starting mission decks
* Unify Yasmina cards (character/mission)

## Issues with multi-track victory conditions

What percentage of the cards need to have a certain threat for the threat to go up? If, say, half the game is at 1 draw/turn, and half is at 2, that's 12 cards total. Getting 3 of a kind there isn't too likely. Maybe advanced cards or some obstacles can have more than one threat tag.

## Advanced Mission Cards

How should you rebuild the mission decks? Maybe for now, you shuffle the new expansion cards into the discard, and place the whole thing back on top.

## Endgame Brainstorming

* Not sure if the Stability track should be represented as a tug-of-war.
* What are the victory condition options?

### N+ Red Bank Tracks are Higher

This is a six-game version, with no sudden death. At the end, the players win if some number of tracks are higher than the Empire's tracks. Perhaps even scoring appropriately based on the number.

### Sudden Death Variant

In this version, if a track reaches X, the game ends immediately.

# 01/06/22

## Weather and Triggers

Could have weather or seasonal effects based on the number of triggers for that season. The more triggers, the worse the weather is.

# 12/30/21

## Mission Card Tags and Triggers

Could have an arc to the game - where there are fairly even threats early, but as cards are added, more military and sorcery threats come into play.

## New Locations

One potential option: players discard a location in each region. The other regions, along with obstacles attached to them, stay in play.

As a variant: the region with the most obstacles is discarded, players only choose if some are tied. That may even be better.

## Timer

Kind of feels like the game timer should just be fixed. Just a flat seven or eight turns.

## Season Effects

Maybe seasons impact movement? Summer locations are easier to move out of in the summer, etc. Or it could be location text.

# 12/03/21

## Character Card Brainstorming

Character card abilities are by their very nature closely tied to obstacles, location abilities, and achivements.

* movement
* investing
* trading
* resource dice (add, manipulate, use)
* obstacles (overcome, discard, add progress, defend against, move)
* triggers (discard, manipulate)
* add dice
* manipulate dice: flip, reroll, split, merge, explode, exchange (6->3 dice)
* working together
* resource track
* achievement: ignore constraint, add, manipulate
* discard a mission card
* look at or manipulate deck (mission, char, ach)

Discord ideas.

* action dice: remove, reroll (this is fairly punative, unless relegated to rerolls or something)
* resource dice: remove, shift
* stress
* obstacles are more powerful
* draw obstacles
* movement is expensive
* can't work together
* achievements are harder

## Keel Discord

* Keel wants to work alone
* Keel's gadgets fail him?

## Thea Discord

* Thea is filled with doubt and excessive caution
* Issues cause her more stress
* Difficult to leave Red Bank
* Stability could suffer
* Wants other characters in Red Bank (protect the homefront first)

## Menas Discord

* Angry at Fuscus

## Fuscus Discord

* Angry at Menas
* Stability impact (theft)
* Alcohol abuse (stress)

## Old Character Card Ideas

* https://github.com/ziapeltagames/six-winters/blob/0efb1979fbfff7ec9ba65b6343407ef1e602738c/csv/set-one-character-cards.csv
* character takes a condition (brutal)
* character loses an action (also brutal)
* mess with resource dice
   * split
   * merge
   * flip
   * bump +1
   * nudge -1
* add discord
* +1 skill temporarily
* remove condition
* gain back stress
* discard foes
* +1 when at a type of location
* reroall resource dice
* move an obstacle

## Action Dice Uses

* 1s: traps (keel)
* 2s: guards (lucia)
* 3s: issues (thea)
* 4s: diplomats (fuscus)
* 5s: foes (menas)
* 6s: powerful foes, conspiracies, investing resources
* Any dice: move, location effects, wheel of trade

Yasmina and Oniri don't generate action dice directly.

# 12/02/21

## Trait / Commitment Brainstorming

Wasn't sure commitment/advancement really fit on achievements, because those are more of a "party" reward. Although... so are skills. Hmm. Perhaps commitment should be wired in to them? The other place was to use it on traits.

How could trait character cards work? Do XYZ to get commitment? Do XYZ to avoid discord?

Honestly, maybe traits aren't needed at all? They might not be adding much. Discord comes from damage and obstacles, and commitment could come from achievements or from obstacles. If there are interesting ideas for traits that can't be encapsulated in character cards, that could be interesting - but really, the same ideas can probably be baked into character decks.

For instance, if discord cards have avoid XYZ for the turn or take a discord, that could easily be a discord card.

### Careful

What would a careful character do? Avoid dangerous obstacles?

### Commitment

* Work with another character on a skill test
* Invest a certain resource
* Overcome a type of obstacle
* Avoid somthing - this is harder, avoid how? Avoid when?

### Discord

* Discord could do avoid easier, using immediate effects
* Immediate: if moving to a space where XYZ, then ABC happens
* You can discard cards at the start of your turn, not whenever you want
* So you'll have to hold a discord card for at least a turn

## Oniri Character Abilities

Should maybe add backlash to different cards than the spendy ones? Or are those Oniri's discord cards?

Spend XYZ discord to discard this card.

Immediate: If doubles backlash.

# 10/28/21

## Achievement Brainstorming

If diagonals are allowed on the "path" achievements, then the corners will never be used.

# 10/22/21

## Achievement Brainstorming

Should the same set of five achievements be in each deck? Also, should achievements be in the deck matching locations where they're used, or locations on the wheel of trade?

Red Bank has the most stability locations, does that mean technology advancements should be in the Red Bank deck?

Settled Lands: Military?

* Empire: Technology, Espionage, Disguise, Thievery, Combat
* Red Bank: Stability, Sorcery, Lore, Command, Survival
* Settled Lands: Diplomacy, Military, Rapport, Tactics, Commitment

OR

* Settled Lands: Stability,
* Red Bank: Technology,
* Empire: Military, Espionage

## Achievements and Regions

The big issue is that achievements just aren't all that coupled to regions. It's a handy organizational device - but it's also misleading, because location resources don't equate to region decks. Should brainstorm non-regional achievements.

## One Achievement Deck

One achievement deck, where players may draw 2 and choose 1, discarding the other one, is a possibility. There are 15 things in the achievement deck. If players draw 6 at the start of the game, that's nearly half of the achievements. Maybe there's a pool of face up achievements? Shared achievements aren't a good idea - those achievements are much better handled individually.

The achievement deck needs to be cycled at some amount? Maybe there are two face up achievements, and when an achievement is finished, players can either take one of the face up achievements, or draw? Or, perhaps at the end of every turn, a new achievement is drawn - and one of the two face down achievements must be replaced. That's slow.

When an achievement is finished, players can either: take a face up achievement, or, take a face down achievement and reset both face up achievements (dig for new ones). How many starting achievements? Six, and players each take two? Leaving two for the face up pile?

Or, maybe before a player chooses, they may clear out any of the face up achievements? That might be cleaner - it's essentially a "choose from X" approach, but there's some insight beforehand. It would let players clear out achievements they aren't interested in.

# 10/21/21

## Achievements and Catch-up

Currently, there are 8 or 9 steps on resource tracks to win the game. That means 2 advances a game is easily enough to win. However, should probably be possible to get more, in order to possibly catch up. It's pretty easy to lengthen/shorten tracks, but harder to tune the achievement deck.

If it's possible to "cycle" the achievement decks, then the number of advances is probably on the order of 2-3. Players could start with the advance they want in play, and probably cycle through 2 more times.

One option is to layer the easier achievements on top of the harder ones. Thus making 1-2 advances not too bad, but getting 3-4, at least early on, would be tough and require a singular focus.

Could do 10 easy (dif 2-3) + 10 hard, or 5 easy + 5 hard (dif 4-5), not sure which mixture would work better.

# 10/20/21

## Current Campaign Evolution Choices

* Locations
   * There are a set of 6 starting locations
   * At the end of the game, players each draw one new location
      * Must swap at least one of them out for locations in play
   * Some cards/effects can burn a location
      * That location should be replaced instead of swapping
* Mission cards
   * Two mission cards are added to each regional mission deck at the end of each session
   * Later mission cards are more difficult than starting mission cards
* Achievements
   * There are two stages of achievements per region: 10 easier / 10 harder
   * In the first 3 years, the easier ones are stacked on top of the harder
   * In the final 3 years, only the harder achievements are used
   * The deck can be cycled through
   * Players draw 2 / keep 1 when getting a new achievement
* Burning Mission Cards
   * An option on some mission cards
   * Removes them from campaign
* New Characters
   * Unlocked via mission cards
   * All cards to unlock characters are in starting mission decks
   * Some locations have starting mission cards - if one of these is drawn, that card is attached
   * Necromancer (Oniri) starts in play
   * An issue from Burgan Vale (Yasmina) is in the deck
      * One non-starting location attaches that issue
   * Lucia starts in the deck
      * One non-starting location attaches the Lucia card
* Discord
   * Primary way to get discord is via conditions
   * Also on some mission card effects
   * Can remove discord by sitting out
* Commitment / Card Advances
   * Driven by achievements
   * Also on some mission card effects (rare)
* Skills
   * Advanced by achievements
   * Never lowered
* Conditions
   * If the highest body/psyche condition is ever taken, it is checked off
   * This locks it for the rest of the game
   * Can be unlocked by sitting out

## Achievement Analysis

* Players should have some control over what achievements to work on
* Players shouldn't have to make progress on tracks they don't wish to
* Searching for content is probably gone for now
   * It's more fiddly than other achievements for sure
* Burning content also isn't a great use of achievements
* Improving experience for characters is a better use for achievements

There are 6 resource tracks and 8 skills = 14. And perhaps one more for experience. Each achievement deck could have 5 or 10 cards in it.

* Empire: Technology, Espionage, Disguise, Thievery, Combat
* Red Bank: Stability, Sorcery, Command, Survival, Commitment
* Settled Lands: Diplomacy, Military, Rapport, Tactics, Lore

How are achievements tied to regions? Although the decks are separate, they really aren't tied to regions. The main advantage is having the difficulties on the backs, as well as having an idea of what's in each deck. The latter is indeed very useful. You could set out all 15 achievements in a big tech tree kind of map, but that would be a much higher cognitive load, and not all that different.

### 10 Card Achievement Decks

Each achievement type shows up twice in each deck. Players can go through each deck once during the game, and then a timer triggers. That would give the possibility of 1-2 advances on each resource track per game.

## New Characters

How should new characters be unlocked?

* Always available - the pool of characters is available from the beginning.
* Time - certain characters are unlocked at certain times.
* Mission cards - overcoming certain mission cards unlocks characters.
* Achievements - certain achievements unlock characters.
* Locations - unlocking some locations unlocks characters.

Players should be able to unlock a character they're interested in, so it probably shouldn't be up to the whims of chance.

### Analysis

Out of these options, the "always available" option is certainly the easiest to implement, followed by unlocking certain characters at certain times. If characters are always available, they would need to be of roughly similar power levels. If one character is better than another in every way, they wouldn't be chosen unless forced to by taking damage or becoming out of action.

It would be interesting to have certain characters become unlocked as the game goes along, and perhaps those characters are stronger. Burning a particularly challenging mission card is an interesting way to unlock characters, although that makes it less obvious how to unlock them.

### Mission/Location Card Option

If overcoming mission cards unlocks characters, those mission cards should probably be attached to Location cards. In which case, the "mission card" option is really a location option, as the locations drive mission card content.

One option: the mission cards for unlocking characters are all starting in play? Or are at least in the initial decks?

## New Locations

* Completely random
* Player choose from set
* Multiple types of locations (random / special)
* Achievements unlock (general / specific)

## Achievement Evolution

Character card advances are a good choice for achievements, since they're lower overhead. Unlocking locations are higher overhead - but should probably also be done using achievements. Burning cards is probably best served with icons on the cards themselves. That would give more flexibility and allow for more strategy. It's also hard to associate burning cards with a region.

One thing: not sure if achievement cards should be per region at all.

* Empire: Technology, Espionage, Disguise, Thievery, Combat
* Red Bank: Stability, Sorcery, Lore, Command, Survival
* Settled Lands: Diplomacy, Military, Rapport, Tactics, Commitment

## Campaign Play

Thinking more about long term play. Some questions:

* What should be on achievement cards?
* How should characters evolve?
* How should achievements evolve?
* How should locations evolve?

Right now, the following can be improved:

* Skills
* Resource Tracks (win conditions)
* Character Decks (both good and bad)
* Mission Decks (can be tuned)

## Non-Achievement Card Option

Been also thinking about what a version would be like that doesn't use achievement cards. Achievement cards are pretty nice, because they can constrain what sorts of dice are needed. There isn't as much freedom, though - which may not be totally a bad thing. However, it's probably possible to do some sort of tech tree map, which is always in play, which players add dice to. As certain patterns are made, resource tracks could be improved, or maybe cards could be burned.

It may be easier to scale a non-achievement card approach over time, making it slightly harder to get better on a particular resource track.

### Pros

* Achievement cards are arbitrarily tied to regions, but there aren't restrictions on drawing them, so this serves little more than a grouping mechanism
* Could give much more flexibility on pursuing strategies

### Cons

* Players may have a singular minded focuse on one resource track - which could get boring
   * There would have to be a mechanism that works against this, perhaps just threats taking down other tracks
   * Or the necessity that other types of resource dice are need to bring one track up
* Probably a higher cognitive load

# 10/07/21

## To-Do Playtest v2

* Color icon refactor:
   * Espionage: black (#000000)
   * Sorcery: orange (#f58231)
   * Technology: maroon (#800000)
   * Diplomacy: lavender (#dcbeff)
   * Military: grey (#4363d8)
   * Stability: blue (#4363d8)
   * Other possible colors: navy(#000075), yellow(#ffe119)

### Finished

* Update achievements: add back burn achievements, character card achievements - feats, maybe recovery achievements?

## Dice Patterns

* High dice: investing resources, defending against many obstacles
* 1s: traps
* 2s: guards (keel)
* 3s: diplomats (fuscus)
* 4s: issues (thea)
* 5s: mobs
* 6s: powerful foes (means)
* Specific dice: achievements
* Any dice: move, location effects, wheel of trade

## 1:1 Achievement Progression

In this version, an achievement card raises a track no matter where it's at. Starting achievements could look like:

* Empire: Technology 3, Espionage 4, Disguise 4, Thievery 2, Burn 2, Commitment 3
   * 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4
* Red Bank: Stability 4, Sorcery 3, Command 4, Survival 2, Combat 3, Commitment 2
   * 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4
* Settled Lands: Diplomacy 4, Military 3, Rapport 3, Tactics 2, Lore 4, Search 2
   * 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4

Advanced achievements would have the same breakdown, but be more difficult, as well as having different requirements. Maybe at the end of each season, players must add 1 resource achievement and 1 skill achievement to the decks?

## Campaign Flow

* Six starting locations are put in play
* After the game, add 2 mission cards to each discard deck, and recreate mission decks
   * These mission cards are more challenging, and have worse threats
* Each player draws one location - and must replace at least one in play
   * Instead of drawing, may choose a special location that has been unlocked

## Achievement Progression

* Types of Achievements
   * 8 Skills
   * 6 Resource Tracks

The search achievement sticks out a bit as an outlier: it's used after the game, where the others are used during the game. Maybe players can randomly pick a location, and then optionally choose a location? Burning cards is also a bit of an outlier - it would probably happen after the game, rather than during. The other issue is that there are quite a few skill and resource achievements, so having many burn or commitment achievements would be tricky.

Another option is to unlock locations from cards as well. Maybe burning cards, unlocking special mission cards or locations, and advancing characters are all effects from mission cards or character cards? Leaving achievements to only advance resource tracks and skills.

For resource achievements, not sure the utility of adding 1 achievements to the deck.

* Espionage Starting: 2
   * Advanced: 2, 2, 2
* Diplomacy Starting: 1, 2
   * Advanced: 2, 3, 4
* Military Starting: 1, 2
   * Advanced: 2, 2
* Stability Starting: 1, 2
   * Advanced: 2, 3
* Technology Starting: 2
   * Advanced: 2, 2, 3
* Sorcery Starting: 2
   * Advanced: 2, 3, 4

* 9 starting resource achievements
   * 16 advanced resource achievements
* 9 starting skill achievements (skills in the 2-3 range?)
   * 8 advanced skill achievements (for skills of level 5?)
* 6 per region at start
   * 8 in each advanced region deck
   * drawing 4 total per turn - may look at roughly half of each deck on every turn

### Sorcery Path

* Victory: Sorcery = 10
* Starting: Sorcery = 3
* Year 1 (2):
   * 2: Sorcery = 4
* Year 2 (2, 3, 4):
   * 2: Sorcery = 5
   * 3: Sorcery = 6
   * 4: Sorcery = 7
* Year 3 (2, 2, 3, 4):
   * 4: Sorcery = 8
   * 2 + 2: Sorcery = 9
* Year 4: (2, 2, 3, 4):
   * 2 + 3: Sorcery = 10
   * 2 + 4: Sorcery = 11
* Year 5: (2, 2, 3, 4):
   * 4 + 3: Sorcery = 12

## Fixed Achievement Decks

Is there a way to have achievement decks that are flat throughout the campaign? That is, a mix of different achievement values and types? The problem is that they'd probably be fairly deep decks, making it hard to find what you're looking for? It also wouldn't scale very well as the campaign went on.

## Mission Deck Setup

Might be interesting to have a wider variety of cards in the initial setup deck.

## Search Achievements

If locations, achievements, and mission cards are random, maybe the search achievement lets players choose a card from one deck, if they don't get what they're looking for?

## Location Option 1 - Fixed Starting, Per Session Random Draw, Player Choice

* The game starts with the same 9 locations each time
* At the end of a session players draw 2 random locations
* Players must swap out 1, but may swap out 2
* The locations swapped out are burned

Pros: Not too much overhead. The locations would be assured of changing at least some.

Cons: Players are somewhat at the whims of fate.

## Unlocking Characters

One of the other sticking points is that unlocking characters is tied to locations via mission cards. Unlocking characters could be handled via achievements. That's not as compelling sounding as overcoming some particular obstacle to unlock them, though.

If unlocking characters is handled via mission cards, then maybe it's possible the mission card comes out on its own? Or it could perhaps be applied to a location?

## Location Cards and Achievements

If location cards determine achievements, what sort of implications does that have? If a location is burned, that seems like it could have a big impact on the ability to create a strategy. Even if it's not burned, it could be tricky to build a strategy. You would need espionage locations to help build up diplomacy. If one got burned, what would that mean if achievements were tied to it?

It would be easiest if locations could just be thrown out randomly, and then replaced as desired. The big sticking point is that locations have resources associated with them, and there is an expectation that you can get all of the resources somewhere.

One option is to have slots for resources, somewhat like slots for triggers. For instance, the empire has espionage, military, and technology. That fixes strategies to some degree as well, though.

## Random Locations

A random starting situation and random additional locations makes the game more unique each time it is played.

## Fixed Starting Locations

Provides potentially more balance in the beginning. Can have other later locations start with really difficult mission cards attached or unlocked.

# 10/06/21

## To-Do

Sketch out location cards at a high level, looking at different resource track levels as well as potential achievement options.

## Achievement Cards - Campaign

Should achievement cards be tied to locations? Or is it better if they're independent? It would be a potentially easy way to bundle them up. If there are 2-4 locations for each region, could have 4-8 achievements for each region.

## Mission Cards - Campaign

Mission cards shouldn't be tied to location cards.  Instead some number should be added to each mission deck every season. These will typically be much more challenging cards, or more complex cards, than the baseline.

## Resource Driven Location Option - Campaign

* Locations have a resource number.
* If locations are in play, and the resource track drops below this number, the location is burned.
* After the game, each player may add 1 location to the game, provided resource track requirements are met.
   * Locations could also add mission cards or achievements to the game?

## Strategic Elements

Need to also shift gears and explore what the late game may look like. How might the world change? What sorts of changes can be represented via the pieces so far?

Most campaign games are mission based, where an unfolding narrative is fixed, and players step through each stage. This game is closer to sandbox games - where it's more about how the world changes in random ways.

## Location Options

Locations feel like one of the main knobs to make the world change and grow over time. Currently starting locations are fixed, some new locations are added each season, and special locations may be purchased using achievements. Could need to remove fixed resource dice from locations, as that may restrict just how much locations can change. But fixed resource tracks also makes locations much more useful, otherwise it's just down to skill.

### Starting Locations

* Fixed
* Random (some)
* Random (all)

### Burning Locations

* Player choice
* Random
* Achievements
* Character cards - Maybe accidentally? Oniri?
* Mission cards - Inidividual cards could burn locations.
* Resource dice/tracks - This is an interesting option. Locations already have resources, maybe they are burned/discarded if the resource track goes below a certain point?

Was thinking random cards come in, and players choose cards to go out. But it could be more interesting/strategic if something during the game told players what locations could be going away.

### Adding Locations

* Random
* Player Choice

# 10/04/21

## Playtest Retrospective

Finished the first playtest of the new dice based game. Lots to think about.

### Discord and Commitment Weren't Engaged With Much

Almost no cards give commitment bonuses, and they're very erratic and difficult to control: making this feel disconnected. Discord was used, but there's also not much of a way to manipulate it. No way to lower the pool, making players very risk averse. The best solution may be to get rid of both of these, at least as pools of currency to track. There's also already a high cognitive load, and adding two pools to the mix may just be distracting.

### Stress Wasn't a Factor

Character stress tracks barely budged. A few stress hits were missed, which contributed - but it still wasn't a big factor in the game. Some of the card effects devoted to discord maybe should target stress, which could serve as a proxy for discord. Perhaps more severe conditions are what add discord cards to a character's deck. That would still open the door to decks which change over time, but it would get rid of two pieces in the game and push more to utilize and under served one. A few obstacles should probably do more damage as well.

### Game Length

Was about right, but should do more simulations to add triggers of different kinds until the standard deviations are low. Also need to lock down what a good expected game length looks like to tune card effects. Currently thinking 8 turns.

### Trigger Mixture

Currently different regions have different mixtures of triggers. This could be a feature or a bug, not sure at the moment. One result of this: you can place a location where it won't receive many triggers. Again, this could be part of the strategy. The trigger mixture at the moment is heavily tilted. May want to leave it irregular, but not *too* irregular.

Do locations need position triggers after all? One thing you could do: make sure the top 6 always cover all 6 resources. Then the bottom 3 could be variable.

### Location Triggers

Locations could leverage the trigger asymmetry if they were back.

### Overcome Obstacle

Need to be very careful about the number of dice needed to take out obstacles. It should be around 2-3 for most obstacles, up to 4-5 for very difficult obstacles. Skill values should be about uncertainty/certainty of information. Instead of difficulty for obstacles being "this much progress is needed" - which also means "this much of your action economy is needed" - it will be "you have more uncertainty about your dice".

If every obstacle can do some sort of stress, even 1+dice may not be needed. Could just spend dice, but need to reroll all dice over skill - difficulty. Thus, if you're willing to take damage, you can keep trying to take out an obstacle without even spending dice.

Also could sometimes have an entry for failing the obstacle, so there is some risk involved.

Using difficulty this way would allow for scaling of skills from 0 to 5.

### Burn Obstacle

Not sure about having burn obstacle options on the card. Rather, it may be better to have them on achievements?

### Invest

Can invest get away from the 1+skill pattern as well? Obstacles have stress - which means rerolling can't really be spammed, but invest doesn't have that. The current invest strategy favors higher dice, which is okay. It might be nice to also decouple invest from the action economy, but then it would need to be something like "spend X dice to grab dice == skill".

Another option is to have the same reroll as overcome obstacle, but you can grab any number of resource dice which match the action dice. Going to leave invest alone for now.

### Reroll Character Cards

There are probably too many reroll character effects. And may not want -or- effects at all, high cognitive load. Some are okay, but should lower them a touch.

### Character Card Iconography

Some of the icons are very confusing, particularly dice that are showing specific values.

### Achievement Difficulty

Is this very useful anymore? Could use it for obstacle stress. Or maybe even overcoming an obstacle? If the mission decks grow and change and become more difficult, then may not need it.

# 09/30/21

## Achievements

Resource achievements must be >= the current dice pool to raise. Skill achievements must be >= the current skill to raise. Search achievements unlock special locations >= search difficulty.

# 09/29/21

## Trade

Trading assets from one type to another seems like it should be impossible. May be enough to have a "must have one of each of the resources" requirement. Trading assets from one type to another really undermines a big part of the game.

# 09/28/21

## End of Game

* Players add two mission cards to each mission deck
* Each player draws one location and one achievement
   * Instead of drawing a location, may spend exploration achievements for purchasing special location
   * Players may swap out current location for drawn or purchased location
   * Players may swap out current achievement for drawn achievement

## Mission Cards Leaving Play Options

* Randomly
   * Low cognitive load
* Via Achievements
* Specified on Mission Card
  * This option may actually be the best
  * More control (can maintain rough timer relationships)
  * Can tie effects to burning a card (Necromancer --> Oniri)
  * Happens more "in real time", rather than as an end of game stage
  * Can have special mission cards that burn other ones (get rid of Undead via spell, etc)

## Location Cards

If locations are how you unlock certain characters, players are really going to want to find certain locations. An achievement could be a good way to do that. It also may be best to have some locations be special - and they have a value needed to unlock them. That way players can spend those achievements without looking at a mountain of locations. 

* Cards Entering Play
   * Each player draws one location at the end of every game, and players may spend to add in special locations from achievement cards.
   * Locations specify if other achievements or mission cards are needed.
* Cards Leavning Play
   * Achievement cards and location cards get swapped out on a 1:1 basis

## Necromancer Use Case Option 1

* Players get achievements to search for a special location
* They spend exploration points to unlock 'Undari's Tomb'
* Undari's Tomb says to add The Last Necromancer to the achievement deck
* When that achievement is played, it says to put The Necromancer into play
* On the achievement, it says if the necromancer is defeated, Oniri is unlocked

## Necromancer Use Case Option 2

* Players get achievements to search for a special location
* They spend exploration points to unlock 'Undari's Tomb'
* Undari's Tomb says to add The Necromancer to the mission deck
* If the Necromancer is burned (not overcome), Oniri is unlocked
* In other words, Necromancer is not an achievement

## Vault Use Case

* Similarly, the vault could just be an achievement, with random dice on it
* And then you match those dice

## Legacy Aspects

Lots of open questions about how the decks and locations grow and change.

* How are the initial mission decks constructed?
   * There are a set of starting mission cards, listed out, and the mission decks are constructed from those.
   * Some of the starting locations have cards as well.
* How are new locations found and played?
   * Do players have to spend certain achievements looking for them? If so, how would that work?
   * Is it part of the game, where X are drawn at the end of each season?
   * Are there regular/special locations? Some are drawn, some must be found?
* How are new achievements found and played?
* How are new mission cards found and played?
* How are mission cards removed from decks?

# 09/27/21

## Areas to Work On

* Trade - particularly trading assets, this probably needs more thought
   * Should this be possible at all?
   * Maybe you can create assets of another type, but it's more expensive?
   * It should be difficult, though, otherwise location tags don't matter, and movement stagnates
* Graphic design
   * Maybe think about breaking up skill/resource tags on locations, put one in the lower left?
   * Hard to distinguish two icons right next to each other
* Mission decks
   * How do they evolve over time?
   * Can cards move between them, or are there three mission decks, each typed appropriately
   * Separate is probably better - almost all the cards are going to be themed for region
   * Adding cards is fairly easy - just some number get added to the deck each season
   * Burning cards is harder - going to be related to achievements
* Achievements
   * Raise skills
   * Raise resource tracks
   * Burn mission cards (typed or not?, for now - not typed)
   * Search for locations (typed or not?, for now - not typed)
* Mission cards
   * What happens if you don't overcome a mission card?
   * Are there rounds?
   * Do you just spend more turns?
   * Is there something special for scenes?
   * For now, will probably have them work the same: with the common scene trait being they get discarded on activation

## Threat and Skill Tags

Skills
Empire Counter({'DISGUISE': 8, 'THIEVERY': 6, 'LORE': 2, 'RAPPORT': 2, 'SURVIVAL': 1, 'TACTICS': 1, 'COMBAT': 1})
Red Bank Counter({'COMMAND': 8, 'COMBAT': 5, 'SURVIVAL': 4, 'LORE': 2, 'THIEVERY': 1, 'RAPPORT': 1})
Settled Lands Counter({'RAPPORT': 7, 'TACTICS': 5, 'LORE': 4, 'COMMAND': 2, 'DISGUISE': 1, 'COMBAT': 1, 'SURVIVAL': 1, 'THIEVERY': 1})
Total {'DISGUISE': 9, 'LORE': 8, 'RAPPORT': 10, 'SURVIVAL': 6, 'THIEVERY': 8, 'TACTICS': 6, 'COMBAT': 7, 'COMMAND': 10}

Threats
Empire Counter({'ESPIONAGE': 8, 'MILITARY': 3, 'SORCERY': 2, 'TECHNOLOGY': 1, 'STABILITY': 1, 'DIPLOMACY': 1})
Red Bank Counter({'STABILITY': 7, 'DIPLOMACY': 1, 'SORCERY': 1, 'ESPIONAGE': 1, 'TECHNOLOGY': 1, 'SORCERYSORCERY': 1})
Settled Lands Counter({'DIPLOMACY': 5, 'MILITARY': 4, 'SORCERY': 3, 'TECHNOLOGY': 2})
Total {'ESPIONAGE': 9, 'SORCERY': 6, 'TECHNOLOGY': 4, 'MILITARY': 7, 'STABILITY': 8, 'DIPLOMACY': 7, 'SORCERYSORCERY': 1}

Tech, Sorcery, and Diplomacy are on the light side. Probably fine if the threat tags are not evenly distributed - they'll become less distributed as the game goes along. Probably need at least three of each tag, otherwise it's pretty predictable. Tech could use a few more.

## Character Card Abilities

* Menas
   * Merge
   * Reroll / Defend (body)
   * Reroll / Attack (foe)
* Thea
   * +1
   * Flip

* Fuscus
   * -1
   * 6s explode
   * Reroll / Defend (psyche)

# 09/24/21

## Threats and Mission Cards

Having trouble getting threats to work - why not just add threat tags to mission cards? That's overloaded, but maybe less overloaded than anything else you could do? It gives another vector of info to the cards, and makes for even more choices. Some cards don't need weird triggers or anything, they can just be a pain for the tag(s) they have.

## Achievement Spends

The one thing that will need to change is burning threats, though. Maybe:

* Raise skills
* Raise resource tracks
* Find special locations (Mostly Settled Lands)
* Burn mission cards (with the related tag)

# 09/23/21

## Threat Deck

The threats are most likely going to need to be put back into a separate deck. It's just too unlikely that enough threats will be drawn otherwise. After all, there are only 12 or so turns currently. Given that, only about 4 threats will be drawn. Even if threats are distinct and put into play as triggers, it's still unlikely that more than 4 or so will be drawn. This means the pattern matching XYZ probably can't work. It's maybe possible to go back to a "bust" kind of threat, checking if the total is over XYZ. That would probably mean untyped threats, purely numeric values. It... could work. Although, even there, players will most likely try to get rid of threats as soon as possible. And if they're interspersed with other sorts of cards - that will be much more likely. There's also no "build up" to the pacing anymore, and the build up was fun. A separate threat deck would put that back on the table.

Maybe it could work as follows:

* Spring (Rds 1 & 2)
  * No threats
  * Normal mission card draws
* Summer
  * 1 threat/region
  * Normal mission card draws
* Fall
  * 2 threats/region
  * No mission card draws
* Winter
  * Game ends

The main thing that was kind of cool is having typed threats in the different mission decks. This would allow players to tune those decks better, and make for "local" Empire strategies. In one threat deck, the Empire strategy is far more global.

# 09/22/21

## Starting, Special, and Standard Mission Cards

Where should attached cards for locations come from? Is it okay to pull them out of the mission deck? Or should they come from a different set of cards? It seems kind of fiddly to have, say, guards in the mission deck, but then use an entirely different set of cards for a location card. Particularly if it also means that special cards get discarded to a different place, an don't go back into the mission deck. It's possible that some location cards attach standard cards and some attach special cards. That's probably okay.

That means special cards need some particular notation.

## Overcoming Obstacles

When obstacles are overcome, should they go into the mission discard pile? This could even be trickier for cards that start attached to locations. If you overcome them, do they go back into the mission deck? Maybe special cards are burned, and standard cards go back into the deck. The "starting" decks are just a list of standard cards for the game, they aren't designated at all.

What's the use case for getting, say, Oniri?

* Get Search achievements to find lost lands
* Pay the cost to add the location into the mix
* Swap out some current Red Bank location for Undari's Tomb
* Undari's Tomb indicates what achievement to add to the achievement deck
* The achievement places the Necromancer into play
* If the necromancer is overcome, it is burned, as indicated on the achievement - and Oniri is unlocked

Could even have two options for obstacles: one which overcomes them, but puts them back into circulation, and one which burns them? That could be interesting for certain characters attached to locations, like diplomats.

# 09/21/21

## Threats

Most likely, threats drawn as triggers will still need to come out, otherwise the threat build up may be too slow.

## On Timers

Did some experiments with times. If only one of the three regions has to match the stage, the game is pretty short - averaging 4 turns.

If players can draw mission cards, the can extend the game a ton, as long as they're willing to draw lots of mission cards:

1 Draw: 7 turns
2 Draws: 13 turns
3 Draws: 29 turns

Not sure the pros/cons of this approach yet. Giving players some control seems good, but it's less good if the option doesn't seem so optional. Additional turns are very important, so it's unlikely players would pass up that opportunity. Also, 29 turns feels too long. Even with quick turns (5 minutes or so), that's multiple hours.

Players can draw 1 card by going to the location and having an encounter there. They can also extend the game by avoiding locations that don't have a matching counter. Most likely, players SHOULDN'T be allowed to draw mission cards by spending action points.

Need to try an additional experiment where each region has a separate timer. Should make the game much longer. Also an experiment where only the top match is drawn (this would reflect the counter method). If that results in 8-10 turns, that's feels close to perfect.

Having a fourth trigger (winter) would also increase the duration, if needed. Winter could be some kind of wild card, like all locations in the region activate. For triggers, having Settled Lands = Summer, Red Bank = Fall, and Empire = Winter is maybe a good pattern. Then the locations would migrate from right to left and top to bottom as the game goes along.

## On Stress

Also wondering about the conditions system. Having a really high stress condition value isn't going to matter much, because most stress will be less than that. Could do something like put dice on each condition, and they tick down until you take the condition? With the caveat that you can't divide up stress between conditions. That would solve the problem, but it's pretty fiddly. It also caps out a conditon's stress at 6 (from the die). Or could start the die at the lowest condition, and tick up the track. If a player takes a major condition, they start with that as their current condition. That feels less fiddly - at least there's only one body die and one stress die for each character.

## On Trade

Trading raw resources around should probably be much easier, or it won't happen much. Maybe it costs 1 or 2 AP to initiate trade, and then you can trade any dice of value 6 or maybe 7 or higher for another die of the appropriate type, rolling it and placing it. That way of doing the wheel of trade is pretty fun, and would encourage much more trading, particularly at the start of each turn.

## Currencies and Regions

Are there certain currencies/effects/tags more common in each region? There are skills and resources more common to a region.

* Empire
   * Psyche
   * Disguise, Thievery
   * Espionage, Technology
   * Guards, Traps, Rebels, Vaults
   * Urban
   * Crone
* Red Bank
   * Body
   * Command, Combat, Survival
   * Stability, Sorcery
   * Commitment
   * Mobs, Undead, Creatures, Spells, Spies
   * Wilderness, Dungeon
   * Maiden
* Settled Lands
   * Discord
   * Rapport, Tactics, Lore
   * Diplomacy, Military
   * Diplomats, Issues
   * Rural

## Scene Brainstorming

Wondering about some kind of "rounds" mechanism for obstacles, where players spend an AP to start overcoming the obstacle, but then can add more skill dice each round. That may make skills not matter as much, though, because you can keep spending over rounds - although, if obstacles have attacks, that could hit the character repeatedly. Using asset dice to overcome obstacles is also very useful. For now, will keep scenes as a one round pass/fail. Also wondering about simplifying scenes and removing the condition on a 'bust'. A bust is no different than an attack, so that's redundant. Busts are also going to be rare - players are only going to engage with scenes when they have a decent chance of overcoming them. Better to focus all the negative parts of scenes as effects for the location or as activation effects, or even as attacks.

## Scene Card Effects

* Increase/decrease movement cost
* Move obstacle to location
* Draw obstacle type
* Increase/decrease difficulty of attached obstacles
* Increase/decrease difficulty of attached threats
* Add/subtract discord
* Add/subtract commitment
* Add/remove conditions

## Resource Dice, Asset Dice, and Progress Dice

It would be helpful to have some clear terminology for where dice can be location: in the resource pools, on location cards, and on achievement cards. Currently thinking about using the terms "resource dice", "asset dice", and "progress dice".

Maybe only the asset dice can help overcome an obstacle? Might be nice for cognitive load, and there are so many ways to mess with dice, it's unlikely they'll remain on cards for long. Although, pulling down dice helps get dice numbers higher for obstacles. The "invest" action should maybe be called "craft" or something like that?

## Scenes

If fortune-at-the-front dice are used, it becomes much less likely that a player will fail to complete a scene. Thus, the "bust" result is probably no longer needed? Is there anything special for a scene, though? Maybe obstacles can be engaged over rounds of time, but scenes are just one shot? Potential unique things scenes can do:

* Focus on number of characters (solo, pair, team, group)
* Only one "round" is possible - scenes never have progress? all or nothing?
* Can affect attached obstacles (tougher, etc)
* Will always go away when activated, potentially after doing something
* Can only have one scene at a location, if another is drawn, discard it instead

If scenes don't have progress, it's _possible_ for a bust to happen, depending on how risky a player is. But it's going to be fairly unlikely, and the worse the bust result is, the less likely it is to happen. Maybe on a failure the scene just activates? Which would normally cause a discard?

# 09/17/21

## Achievement Decks

Current idea: have three decks, near each region. The back of the card has the current region difficulty (if deck is empty, use year, otherwise 2-6). Players can draw from any deck with choosing achievements, and each player gets two. Players spend the achievements they get on their characters.

Need to make an achievement UI. Can draw from any region.

If going to cut out cards, the two really good candidates are achievements and locations. These will change less, and there are fewer of them. Also very tactile and will interact with them. May be worth cutting out achievement and location cards for now?

Is there a way to playtest without this? Maybe just divide them by location.

## Playtest Notes - Achievements

Really not sure about how achievements should match with region. It feels like achievements should only be purchased with invested resources from that region, although that's super constraining. But if that isn't the case, achievements should probably be in their own area. Having an achievement deck for a region when you don't have to spend from that region is a mismatch for sure.

However, having the achievements match to the regions gives a ton more control. For instance, if Empire achievements let you deal with threats, and there are lots of threats, may want to focus on the Empire. That control and predictability would be lost in a giant deck of threats. Maybe it can be solved as simply as having achievement decks in their own space on the board, not next to the regions.

There's also the "how many" achievements question. Six is a chunk. That may be pretty tough to plan around. Three or four feels more tractable. Maybe there are three achievement decks, based on regions, but players can populate the active achievements from any deck they want.

Or maybe there's a way to give players control over their achievements. Each player having 2 achievements felt pretty good in playtest. This could also fold into another thought: it felt cleaner to pull resource dice directly onto achievements, without the "middle man" of the location cards. Combos kind of go out the window, though. Also, can a different player invest?

Maybe invest is a free action if there's a die at a location. Or it still costs one, but any uninvested dice can be left at a location, making them easier to use in the future? Perhaps you can grab dice at a location without spending an action die. What terminology should this use? Resource Pool, Location Resource Die, Invested Resource (Achievement)?

This feels much cleaner. The main thing that's given up is potential number+color combos. But... that's about it. And in exchange, it divides the state between players a bit, sharing the cognitive load, and placing dice directly on achievements is much easier to track. There still can be a number/color breakdown on individual achievements.

Could even have one achievement deck, but maybe draw X at the start of the game, and players can either choose any of those, or draw blind. Maybe draw 7 and place them face up, each player takes 2, and the remaining 3 are left face up.

## Mission Cards

How does the mission deck change over time? How should different sorts of mission cards be labeled? At the moment, threats, achievements, and locations evolve - but the mission deck doesn't.

Locations probably need starting obstacle or scene cards. This "seeds" the situation to some extent. But if that's an option, it immediately begs the question: what kind of obstacles are there? Starting deck obstacles, obstacles tied to achievements (a la the Necromancer, a Vault, etc), and obstacles tied to locations (guards).

Can use Base and Special for now. May expand into Base, Advanced, and Special. Could have this pattern for locations, threats, achievements, and mission cards.

For now, will keep the obstacles and scenes fixed. It's easy enough to have those decks change over time as well, maybe in response to different events: add zombies, remove zombies, do XYZ. Etc.

# 09/15/21

## Discord and Commitment

Having pools for both players feels the easiest to manage, in terms of how fiddly they are and making it easy to decide where/how to add/remove. It also lets different cards add/subtract to them, which could create pressure for players to move around more.

## Discord Overflow

Each player draws a character card, and adds one discord to the character drawn.

## Commitment Overflow

Each player gets to choose one character, and add one commitment.

## Achievement Combos

Having multiple achievements that can be earned at once is interesting, but it requires some handling of the sequencing. At the moment, will allow it, with the current sequencing:

* Spend all resources
* Apply matching achievements
* Draw new achievements

## Rough Action Sketch

* Fill action dice pool up to 6 at start of turn
* Move - spend 1-3 action dice of any value to move
   * Eventually this will be listed on the card (cost will be to leave, not to enter)
   * For now, it's 1 to move along Empire, and 2 to move along RB/SL, and 3 to move between SL and Empire
* Invest - spend 1 action die of any value to start investing
   * Then spend up to skill number of dice, pulling in resource dice <= value of dice spent
* Overcome - spend 1 action die of any value to overcome obstacle
   * Then, lock action dice equal to skill value, and reroll the rest
   * Finally, spend dice up to skill number on obstacle
   * Threats are always a sum of action dice and resource dice to overcome
* Trade - spend 2 action dice to trade invested die, or 1 to trade resource

* Unskilled: as a skill of 1, but must use lowest remaining die for any cost
* Achievements: may be purchased using any invested dice and may combo them
* Timers: Each time one region goes through a cycle, a season advances
   * After three seasons, the game is over
   * When a region has gone through each stage, draw 2 triggers instead of 1

# 08/28/21

## Discord and Commitment

These are probably going to be offloaded into one pool. Or, they may need to be per character. Another option is to keep the pools as per-player pools, but only assign to them by giving discord to characters. Having something in the game that can add to a pool without any characters being there is pretty handy, though. It makes players want to track that source down and deal with it. Otherwise, characters can get by with avoiding anything on the table. Having one pool for discord and commitment is tricky, in terms of using them. Do they overflow? If so, what happens? Doesn't totally feel right to only have one pool for each, but may go with it for now.

* Players could choose.
* Character with highest/lowest skill of a certain type (death spiral, though).
* Everyone (ouch).
   * Also feels really uniform, kind of boring.
* Spotlight player.
* Spotlight character.
* All characters in region.
   * This one seems close-ish to what was there before. It would encourage players to keep characters together, though. Since it would limit double discord.

Another option is to get rid of those as pools, and make them direct character tracks. That's much higher granularity, though.

## Obstacle Movement

Movement could be placed on obstacle cards, or could be on achievement cards. Seems easiest to put it on obstacle cards - and then if the location is activated, the card moves. Given the small number of spaces, it also makes it easy to have movement based on criteria like "nearest character" or "most resource dice".

# 08/16/21

Need to move toward a full playtest. Too many unknowns in the streamlined playtest version. Will do quick versions of achievements, locations, and obstacles.

# 08/13/21

## Playtest Notes

* Already vastly better with increased pools and skills as well as achievement difficulties.
   * The main thing: number of dice for an achievement and pool size need to be fairly closely aligned.
* The "combo achievement" option is also pretty cool.
   * Although, it may require some careful sequencing - probably should collect all achievements prior to refilling the achievement deck.
* May need dice limits on locations as well.
* Achievements still feel a little too easy.
   * Also, should they cost actions to complete?
   * They're still a little weird, given they aren't attached to a location.

## Playtest Prep

* One more time doing restricted region playtest - although not going to get too much info from this.
* Iterated once on the character cards, added some variety.
* Will have resource pools of 3.
* Will add 1 to all the character skills.
* Going to iterate once on the achievements as well.

## More Achievement Notes

One of the things about fixed numbers is the difficulty in adjusting dice. Cards can do it, but there's no action that does it. Maybe if enough cards can do it, it may not be a big deal. But that could be a vote more in favor of totals or patterns like "pair", which are both far more flexible.

## Card Movement Costs

One option is to put movement costs on each site card for the cost to move _to_ the site.

So, like, Empire: 2, Red Bank: 3, Settled Lands: 4. Or Empire: 1, Red Bank: 3, Settled: 3, etc. You could even have a "can't move" there icon, or a special tag for port locations, etc.

# 08/12/21

## Next Playtest

Event though it's not ideal to play only one region - may give it another go with some tweaks to the achievements, character cards, skills, and dice pools.

### Skills and Pools

For now, going to add 1 to all the skills and starting resource pools. That will give characters more dice to work with.

### Character Cards

Going to ignore the conditional character cards for now. That may honestly end up being too high of a cognitive load, anyway.

## Patterns and Obstacles

There are different potential patterns in the game, both for obstacles and achievements. Might be worth really streamlining these. Achievement patterns are kind of all over the map. But obstacles might be narrower.

* Defense/progress consists of many lower valued dice.
* Attacks consist of fewer high valued dice.

So, strikers should be good at splitting dice, while attackers are better at merging dice/+1. Rerolls are pretty universal, as are exploding dice and flips.

Could also have explicit defense and strike cards, based on type of defense or type of obstacle. A little less elegant, though.

### Achievements

* Sets of Colors
   * Any X colors
   * Specific colors: red green blue or blue blue red, etc
   * For now, specific colors would be better
   * Low numbers would be preferred, as they're easier to get
   * Cards: -1, reroll, flip
* Sets of Numbers
   * Any set of X matching numbers
   * Specific numbers: 2 2 2 or 3 3 or even 2 2 3 3
   * Cards would be useful either way, depends on the range of numbers, although split seems particularly useful
* Set of Specific Dice (Color + Number)
* Total Value
   * Better to have high numbers
   * Cards: +1, merge, flip
* Total Value of Multiple Colors
* Sequence of Numbers

Could probably get pretty far with: lists of colors, lists of numbers, and total. The number of dice, types of dice, and values would all contribute to difficulty.

Considering how much of the game is a pattern matching exercise, it'd kind of be cool if there was a way to overlap achievements. As in, maybe when you spend dice, you pool them up - and you can cash in as many achievements as are applicable? That could be really interesting. Probably doesn't work very well with "totals", but definitely could work if there are numbers and colors.

That would incentivize players to invest tons of dice for big spends. Not sure if that's good or bad. If there's a way to mess with invested dice with obstacles... could be pretty interesting.

# 08/11/21

## Playtest Notes

* For this session, going to have two achievements, because there's only one region
   * Base difficulty is all the stars added together
   * In the future, may only have one achievement per region (so three achievements going at the same time)
* Having only one die in a resource pool is very constraining
   * Particularly if a card operates on more than one die of a resource type, won't help if there aren't multiple dice
* Similarly, having a skill of 0 is constraining, because there's no "beginner's luck"
* Both Fuscus and Keel have similar cards so far

## Exchange and Achievements

Wondering if there's a way to simultaneously bring exchange into the game, and make for more flexible achievements. Achievements need certain resources (this is good), and locations have different resources (also fine), but, it's possible for there to be a mismatch between locations and achievements. It'd be nice if there was a way to exchange resources out. Maybe an exchange action can switch out a raw resource *or* an invested one. That would let players, say, get a resource die they need for an achievement even if they don't have a location with that resource. Not a bad idea. However, it could encourage stagnation. After all, if investing is 1 - you could just invest, exchange, invest, exchange, etc. Why move locations?

Would make sorcery interesting - because it goes to everything, but nothing goes to it. So would really want at least one sorcery location in the game, or wouldn't be able to fill those achievements.

## Discord/Commitment Economy

The other tricky part - in moving toward an open movement environment, is that each player doesn't really own their discord pool. Perhaps when the pool overflows it raises one character's discord, rather than all of their discord? Or, could go the other extreme - each character has their own pools. That's even more fiddly, though. Having global pools is interesting. Will go with that for now, and see how it goes.

## Action Economy

Using action points is interesting - and makes movement more impactful, but not sure what a good system is. Maybe 1 to overcome and 1 to invest, and 2 to move?

* Move - Varies (see card)
* Invest - 1
* Overcome - 1
* Exchange - 1/die (related resource for location, or any invested die)
   * Swap out the die for the next one on the exchange track
   * If sorcery, swap out for any die
* Cooperation - Add highest discord
* Location Action - Varies

## Threat Option 2

Like the idea of threats happening if 3 or more symbols match. Any threats with those three matching symbols hit one of the resource tracks.

Really not sure about the all or nothing overcome approach for threats. It would be pretty frustrating to not be able to do anything - that's one of the red flags. So leaning towards having each threat able to be overcome independently. Players will tend to get rid of any that have 2 matching, but that's part of the strategy!

# 07/28/21

## Character Card Abilities

* Split a die
* Merge two dice
* Reroll a di(c)e
* Duplicate a di(c)e
* Gain a di(c)e of a certain type
* Cause stress directly (Attack)
* Exchange di(c)e in resource pools
* Swap out 1 die for other dice (6 --> 2 ones)
* Defense
* +1
* -1
* Flip die
* Exploding dice
* Exploding dice by type (sorcery)
* Immediate effects: sorcery backlash, discord, etc, based on traits

Most of these seem pretty straightforward, although gaining a die seems tricky? Where would it go? Can you just drop it on a location? Doesn't seem quite right. Will probably skip that for now.

## Spotlight Locations

Maybe some locations have special actions (trade, recover stress, etc) that take some amount of action points. It would make it a little cleaner - cards wouldn't have to be split up so much.

## Trade

Probably needs to be driven by cards. Could also be a location action. It could also be an option all the time - but that gets a little cumbersome, and it seems like it would distract from the game. How would it work if it's from a card? Is it limited by a resource type? As in, Thea can exchange into or out of Stability? Or is it open ended trading from any resource to any resource. The problem with using cards is that it will be fairly limited, and limited it even more by not allowing trading from anywhere could be an issue.

Or maybe you can trade as an action while on a related resource location? Or from a Red Bank location?

## Card Play

Most cards modify dice. They may be played during a test. Even this is tricky - for example, if you have a +1 card, can you play it on a resource die, and then not take the resource die? Essentially modifying what's in the pool? That's one step away from just letting players play cards whenever.

You may only play cards during a test: can play them on either skill dice or resource dice. Seems cleaner at that point to allow cards to modify skill dice or resource dice matching the location type.

Maybe obstacles don't have resource dice types? Was already headed that way - and that would make this rule much cleaner. Would that get wonky? Maybe not. Some obstacles might be fixed at a location, so the resource die would be fixed. Cards that move could change what's useful - guards could be Disguise + Stability or Disguise + Espionage. This changes the fiction, how the guard is overcome in the narrative. But it would probably make sense still. And then card play is very clean: test dice or resource dice either invested at the location or from the pool matching the location type. That lets players modify invested dice and resource pool dice. The key point: you do have to be at the location, so movement would matter.

## Tests (Overcome)

* Roll skill dice
* Allocate resources from related pool
   * Each skill die may take one resource die if skill die >= resource die
* Allocate invested resource
   * Resources at site character is located at may be invested freely
* Cards may be played as desired

## Tests (Invest)

* Roll skill dice
* Allocate resources from related pool
   * Each skill die may take on resource die if skill die >= resource die
* Cards played as desired

## Invested Resources

Can players modify invested resources? How? One valid option is to make it impossible, although that could be somewhat frustrating and limit options.

* Can't change invested resources
   * Easiest to remember via rules, but it could result in resources not getting used
* Any card can be used to change invested resources
   * High cognitive load
   * Makes the spatial game matter much less
* May only play cards at dice at character's location
   * This isn't a bad option, a little fiddly on the rules front
* Cards are explicitly for invested resources
   * Really limited ability - not going to be used very often
* Can change invested resources during a test
   * Also okay, but becomes more about the test?

# 07/25/21

* Finished the region and character deck programs
* Need to come up with some initial rules for card limits

## Threat Brainstorming

Unifying the threat deck makes sense in the 9 location version of SW. But it would be nice if threats had their own flavor - beyond just the ability to lower resource tracks. The one nice thing about the earlier threat pattern: threats weren't tied to the same cycle of timers, and it was somewhat unclear when they would trigger. Getting rid of twists, and using threats in their place could be interesting. What if threats are just placed at locations, like they were before for spotlight locations? Since each location is tied to a resource, the threat could attack the resource of the attached location.

### Threat Option 1

Get rid of twists, and there are 13 or 14 threat cards in the mission deck. They have different backs, making it easier to distinguish them. They enter play face down at the site. Getting rid of them is based on current difficulty. But you need a number of successes equal to the number of threats, you can't do partial successes. If the location triggers, you flip over the threat cards. If the total is higher than the defense of the location, your resource track goes down.

### Pros

Threats don't all happen during the same bust phase. Any track is susceptible to a threat.

### Cons

Seems like they could trigger pretty frequently, if a timer causes them to flip. So, perhaps counterintuitively, if stages advance and more triggers are drawn, will make it less likely threats reach a higher value. Also makes threats a little less thematic. No variety in how to overcome threats.

# 07/16/21

## Next Steps

* Make a computer program that can represent one region - random locations, a draw deck, a timer discard, and an achievements deck.

Things to look for: how many obstacles, scenes, and threats should be attached to a site? Is there a limit? Does there need to be? Are threats a kind of scene?

## Three Region Rules Option 2

Might be able to have location cards and achievements come from one unified deck. Obstacles is quite a bit harder, though. Some sites could certainly be generic, while some could be tagged to regions. Achievements are also, in some sense, already broader than one region. They could span multiple regions.

## Three Region Rules Option 1

This option leans pretty heavily on there being different sites, obstacles (scenes, threats, foes, traps, issues, diplomats), and achievements for each region.

* Start play
   * There are 9 fixed locations, 3 in each region for each of the different triggers, at the start of the campaign
   * There three decks of 10 achievements for each region
   * There three decks of 20 mission cards for each region
* During play
   * Refill resource pools
   * Refill hand to 3 cards
   * Take actions
      * Players take actions in order
   * Triggers - each player activates one for each region in which they have a character
      * Each region has its own timer track for the three phases - if the trigger matches the current phase, it advances
      * If it moves off of the waning phase, the timers activate and the season advances
      * When winter comes, the year is immediately over
   * Encounters
* After play
   * Spend achievements to advance tracks as desired
      * May spend spotlight achievements to draw spotlight locations
      * May spend threat achievements to remove threats from any single deck (starting with weakest threat)
   * Each player draws a new location, a new achievement, and a new threat
      * Discard down to 9 locations and 10 achievements per region
      * The threats are added to the decks listed on the front of the card

### Pros

Little more intuitive to create content - can be more thematically tied to situation. There's also a little more prediction there, because certain regions will tend to have certain kinds of obstacles, scenes, and achievements.

### Cons

Going to be fiddly to maintain the different decks, for sure.

## Three Region Achievemnt Cards Option 1

The first choice is a single deck of achievements - that perhaps changes over time. Players don't have much control over this. This isn't great, though, because the players don't have a way to focus on going after certain tracks.

## Three Region Site Cards Option 1

One nice thing about a three region version: could probably enforce choosing sites such that every possible resource die is covered. So, achievements would be able to require anything.

* Amaranthia: Stability, Sorcery
* Empire: Espionage, Technology
* Hinterlands: Diplomacy, Military

Each region could start with a small set of cards to choose from - with players needing to choose at least one of each of those types. Maybe you can lay out the board somewhat randomly - but then be deliberate about choosing developments? That's a possibility.

## Three Region Site Cards Option 2

Could also be the case that site cards don't have resources tied to them at all. Instead, there could be slots on map for certain types of resources.

## Three Region Verion

Really thinking hard about switching from each player having one of two regions, to each player going to all the regions at once. Would this mean one giant deck of sites, obstacles, and achievements? It could. Although, they're so themed around regions - having separate decks may make more sense. At least for obstacles. It's possible sites could be generic enough to fit anywhere. Although, you would probably need certain sites based on their resource dice.

### Pros

It kind of solves the nagging feeling that movement doesn't matter as much. It also makes for a clean world map - no more weirdness from spotlight locations or other things like that. It _could_ mean more co-operation, not sure.

### Cons

Of course, the timers and achievements would require lots of thinking to tune correctly. There's also the chance one player dominates the game, because both players actions would be far more intertwined.

## Event Card Rethink

Have been thinking about event cards. Not sure they're all that interesting, compared to other cards. They're also very fortune-at-the-end, which I've been trying to avoid. One option is to make them more predictable, so that each mission type has a kind of event which happens more frequently.

Another thought is to maybe swap them out with threats. It would be nice to not have one more deck of cards (the campaign deck), if possible. Although, the campaign deck is currently kind of cool. If they are threats - they'd need to be able to build in severity over time. And the way the campaign deck can form a strategy for the Empire is also cool. That's tough to duplicate in the mission deck without a decent amount of setup.

## Mission Deck Threat Option 1

One option is for each of the three regional mission decks to change over time. That would match the site and achievement decks. For that to work, though, some cards would need to come out somehow, and some cards would need to be added somehow. But it is interesting - in the sense that each region could have their own individualized and changing "threats" and "theme" over the campaign. For that to work, though, cards have to leave the deck somehow - and enter the deck somehow. That's particularly tricky to do while maintaining a rough balance of timers to triggers. One option is that only threat cards enter and leave that way.

At the beginning of the campaign, each regional deck starts with certain cards in it - including the threats. At the end of each session, random threat cards are added to each deck. These grow in severity over time. Threat cards can be removed by spending achievements - some achievements let you tune your regional deck.

### Pros

Should be easier to set up / tear down, since each deck tracks its own state. So when you start play, can just shuffle and go. It also meets the criteria of threats which get harder over time, as well as having a different focus (for instance, Military, etc).

### Cons

Worried about dilution of other event types. Although, this could be fixed with rough number of timer/trigger cards for threats. The other issue is that threats could grow to dominate the deck. Of course, if they're bad enough - that would be motivation to use achievements to pull them out.

It's also a little weird that going to a certain region changes where the threats are coming from.

## Mission Deck Threat Option 2

In this option, there is a pool of threat cards that changes over time. At the end of each session, new threats are added to this pool. Then, the threat cards are divided up into each deck for that mission.

### Pros

Has a more general "threat" agenda for the Empire - rather than the slightly weirder mix of threats from each region deck.

### Cons

Way more fiddly. Have to pull all of them out at the end of the game, add new ones, and shuffle them in again. Kind of a pain. There's also potentially strategy in having different regions have different kinds of threats.

## Threat Rethink

Thinking of getting rid of events (some of these events will get offloaded to character abilities - which makes more sense), and having threats go back to being mission cards, along with obstacles, scenes, and twists. How would a threat work, though? Is it more like a scene? More like an obstacle? Could you have multiple threats attacking the same resource track going at once?

Threats feel more like obstacles than scenes, in the sense there probably should be multiple threats that can happen at once. The easiest is to give them all bust conditions that will lower a resource track. That way they can linger for a bit - but then activate if there's a bust. That does mean there's a conservative way to play, where you advance the stage yourself - and try not to bust. But, that could also mean the threat doesn't get discarded - so it'll be a dangerous way to play in the final phase. Also, if threats are shared, the bust could get triggered from either player?

Players do get the opportunity to work against the threats, though - so it's somewhat workable. It's also less fiddly than trying to do a countdown with progress or something like that. Which is a pain.

This means there wouldn't be defenses for spotlight locations anymore. And maybe there aren't even spotlight locations? This change would definitely ripple out. It does make sense, probably, to have threats be at a neutral location.

# 07/14/21

What's the structure of an obstacle card? Was thinking of having a defense section, which consists of various patterns of dice and progress numbers. Achievement cards are the means by which obstacles and scenes scale over time. However, they could add to the difficulty, the progress, or the defense. Progress may be the best of the three. It's nice because too high of a defense is boring, there would be too many failures. Somewhere around 3 or 4 is the sweet spot. Too much higher or lower isn't great.

However, there's some weirdness going that route. If the obstacle progress changes between turns, a scene or obstacle could be completed when it isn't the players turn! Hmm. That's kind of strange. Attack or defense is cleaner in that sense.

Should all scenes and obstacles have the same basic defense, then? Equal to the current difficulty? If they do, there's no reason to put that onto cards.

## Obstacle/Scene Legend

They all have a standard defense for one progress equal to the current mission difficulty. Then they have optional patterns for additional progress. Finally, they have optional patterns for stress, discord, and other effects. The progress amounts and stress effects do not vary. It could be nice to vary stress - but for now will try to use fixed amounts.

## Splits, Merges, Even, Odd, Fixed

Going forward with obstacles and scenes, it could be cool to match up attack, defense, and obstacle types with certain patterns of dice. That would allow characters to be better/worse at certain types of obstacles without making it explicit. For instance, high numbers (merge), could be more common for defense. While pairs (splits) could be better for attacking and making progress.

Could even have low numbers be useful in some contexts.

## Common Patterns

There are generators and patterns. Patterns accept dice and generate either more dice or other effects.

* Achievements
   * Have a wide variety of patterns, don't usually generate anything else
   * Always typed by one or more resource
   * Total+: Adds up to the listed total
   * Single+: The most common, matches a single die of the value or higher
   * Single-: Matches a single die of the value or lower
   * Single+ Type1, Single+ Type2, etc
   * Pair: Pair of two different types
   * Three of a kind: Three of a kind of three different types (hard!)
   * Set: A set of any value of the listed types of dice
* Obstacles
* Scenes

## Obstacle Movement

Another wrinkle: there are now multiple locations with the same trigger type in play. That can wreak havoc for sequencing activations of obstacles. It used to be that only one location would activate during each trigger phase. Now there could be two or even three. This is mainly an issue for movement.

You almost have to do: move all obstacles that can move. Then activate all spaces. Or do it the other way around: activate then move. But if it's by space, the sequencing is kind of a nightmare. Or you could have an entirely different movement phase.

Were would a movement activation come from? Could put movement icons on the back of the trigger deck. Previously, experimented with an "acitve" scene that handled movement, based on icons. In some ways, it is nice to not clutter up cards with movement stuff. But there is no longer one active scene.

Could always do the back of mission cards. Or could do achievement cards. Doing the back of mission cards would give played _a lot_ of info, so that's not ideal. When would obstacles move? Maybe at the start of each round.

# 07/07/21

Brainstorming standard mission deck.

## Differentiating Obstacles

Should give some thought to differentiating obstacles. Particularly scenes vs. other kinds of obstacles. As it stands, they're all very similar, except that scenes don't move. But that doesn't feel like enough of a difference. Scenes could also be more variable - that is, some scenes give you benefits for overcoming them, while the other obstacles are primarily negative. In WotA, scenes are how you progress to the end of the mission. Here, though, that's driven by timers.

Maybe scenes can focus more on number of characters? Solo scenes, group scenes, etc? That could be a tag - how many characters are allowed in the scene.

There's also the question of whether these scenes are needed at all. In some sense, achievements are like scenes. Just longer scale scenes. In RPGs, scenes are the core unit of play - they highlight how characters grow and change over time. Perhaps scenes can focus more on discord, commitment, harmony - characters working together or growing apart? Does that make sense? And other kinds of obstacles can perhaps focus on stress or progress more.

Although, trait cards were focusing more on discord and commitment.

## Mission Deck: Brainstorming Twists

In this version, there are obstacles, scenes, twists, and events. Scenes are basically obstacles. Could probably work them into that framework. The main difference is that scenes don't move around, and go away at various points in the game, while other obstacles only go away when they're overcome.

Twists attach to locations, scenes, or obstacles. They typically add additional skills or resources to the base version. They could also increase/decrease difficulty, add tags, add conditions, add additional activations, or busts. This is a way to give obstacles more variety.

Whether or not they're on separate cards is mainly a pacing issue. Will need to playtest to figure out if there are too many/too few obstacles. If twists are on separate cards, they'll probably be discarded frequently because there is nothing to attach them to. However, if obstacles cards have two sections, one for the scene and one for a twist, there would be many twists in play - perhaps too many. It also makes the cards busier.

# 07/04/21

Also need to revisit the achievement terminology. There are lots of potential options, but some of them may not be very interesting.

* Total value of any number of dice
* Total value of a specific type of dice
* Total value across specific types of dice
* Specific types of dice
* Unique types of dice (Set?)
* Specific values of dice
* Matching values of dice (Pair? Triple? X-of-a-kind?)
* Matching values across unique types of dice
* Overcoming obstacles

# 07/03/21

Following the idea of using a flexible/decoupled achievement deck, next step is to create the set of standard achievement cards.

## Achievement Brainstorming

Can standard achievements be burned? Or does the standard imply that they're always the same. Kind of feels like the latter. It does seem nice to have a chance for weirder achievements, though, without special locations.

Standard locations should probably be able to add special achievements, as well as special mission cards. And then those achievements may be burned, which could have consequences.

Yet another option is a fairly deep well of achievements. But if they're related to difficulty - that's kind of a backwards pattern. They would basically get easier over time as they're filtered out - which isn't quite right.

Better to add more difficult achievements in over time. Maybe that justifies the use of some standard achievements that my be burned? For now, standard achievements can't be burned and don't have larger impacts on the world.

## Mission Deck Construction Brainstorming

There are currently four types of mission cards. Standard/Special X Spotlight/Timer. Requirements: deck has a rough ratio of timer:trigger cards, locations will need starting obstacle cards on them occasionally, and achievements may need special obstacle cards.

### Mission Deck: Option One (Fixed Standard Deck)

In this option, the standard deck is always a fixed set of cards. Special cards could be added to the deck, but all the standard cards are always played. This makes for a very quick setup, if the standard cards are delineated in some way. In this case, the starting cards on locations would all be special.

### Mission Deck: Option Two (Build Standard Deck)

In this option, there are more standard cards than needed. The first step is to add cards to the various locations, and then add cards to the mission deck as described by locations. Finally, a certain number of mission cards are counted out. Clearly, much more fiddly. It does allow for more randomness in the standard deck, however. It also opens the door to have a bigger threat: a dragon, undead, The Autarch, etc. And an achievement could remove them from the deck. Or change it over time.

### Pros/Cons

It's easy enough to start using the first option, because it's quicker, and move to the second if something is too limiting. Really, one of the only patterns that's impossible is certain cards in the deck that go away because of mission results. That is, an adapative mission deck. It also _could_ be too predictable if the same cards keep coming out.

Actually, could bring in weird creatures via achievements as well. For instance, there could be a zombie plague achievement. And if the Tomb is destroyed - it gets burned. That kind of "back doors" in the monsters. Also, the source of the undead could be hinted at on the location card.

## Undari's Tomb Brainstorming

Thinking of options for one particular location to help flesh out design patterns.

### Undari's Tomb: Option One (Special Loc)

Undari's Tomb is a special location. So it must be found via other achievements, and then adding it to the Amaranthia location deck. When chosen, it has a special achievement to kill the Necromancer there. If the Necromancer is killed, Oniri is unlocked. It also has some special mission cards - to add undead to the location and to the deck.

### Undari's Tomb: Option Two (Common Loc)

Undari's Tomb is already available. Same as above, but don't have to search for it. The nice thing about searching for it - it's nice to have a 1:1 between special locations, special achievements, and special mission cards.

### Undari's Tomb: Option Three (No Special Mission Cards)

In this option, there are no undead mission cards just for this location. They're already in the mission deck. However, this mission would have a way to burn all of the undead from the game. This is an interesting way to have the mission deck adapt over time.

### Pros/Cons

The special/not special location isn't that big of a deal. The real issue may be how the mission deck is constructed. It's important for each region mission deck to have a rough ratio of timer to non-timer cards.

## Unlocking Characters 

Unlocking new characters probably shouldn't involve spending these achievements. Rather, it may be a good use of special achievements. Need to flesh out how these special achievements work.

# 06/25/21

## Types of Cards

* Mission Cards: Standard/Special, Spotlight/Timer, Event/Obstacle/Scene/Twist
* Achievement Cards: Standard/Special
* Location Cards: Standard/Special, Empire/Amaranthia/Hinterlands, Wilderness/Urban/Rural/Dungeon/Vault/Tavern
* Character Cards: Standard/Discord/Commitment/Trait
* Campaign Cards: Threat/Quiet/Development

## Trade

One big question: is trade a thing?

## Achievement Breakdown

Empire

3 Espionage
2 Espionage
2 Sorcery
4 Technology
4 Disguise
3 Lore
4 Thievery
3 Combat
2 Threat
3 Threat

## Achievement Categories

Besides resource tracks, skills, and manipulating the threat deck, what other points are there?

Developments? Should there even be developments? It's a WotA thing - but there's also plenty already going on. How would they work? Would you add them to the campaign deck? Spotlight locations? Similar thing there - are those worthwhile? Would they have a cost? How does trade factor in?

Unlocking characters may make sense. Maybe unlocking locations?

Empire: Threats
Amaranthia: Developments
Hinterlands: Locations (Using this approach - the special locations would be locked, and would have costs?)

## More Achievement Ideas

Another achievement idea, besides 1 Achievement : 1 Reward, is some kind of set collection approach. Maybe they're currencies? Like, if you want to raise the Stronghold's Espionage track to 3, you have to spend 3 Espionage achievements. You would need a ton of achievements to make that work, though.

Actually, if there are 10 early, 10 mid, and 10 late achievements, could put a specific mix of achievements into the deck.

1 Espionage, 1 Technology, 1 Disguise, 1 Thievery, 1 Combat, 1 Lore, 3 Threats. + Special Achievements
1 Stability, 1 Sorcery
1 Diplomacy, 1 Military

Problem with the 1:1 achievement approach and deckbuilding, is that it could become pretty easy to raise tracks. For example, 1 Stability and 1 Sorcery or something like that. There's also the situation that, in actual play, it's probably rarely the case that you would skip an achievement or make any kind of decision based on the reward. Kind of can't see that happening. Which is why rewards were decoupled in the first place. Although decoupled rewards have the downside that resource tracks are vastly more important than skill tracks. So having hard rewards gets around that.

Could definitely have a bigger achievement deck, and you choose random achievements. However, 10 track increases seems like... a lot. What's the right number?

It's around 1 resource track achievement, and maybe 2 or 3 skill achievements, along with a threat achievement. That's only 4 or 5 cards for the 1:1 achievements. Which sure isn't many. They'd need to be pretty tough to make the challenging. But having achievements out for a long time is also kind of boring and static.

Could divide achievements into resource track, skill, and special rewards. Adding up points for each of those is kind of fiddly, but that would work, I suppose.

Raising a resource track = X points
Raising a skill track = X points
Special rewards = X points

Actually - that might be kind of cool? It's certainly fiddly, but it could be interesting. For instance, sorcery rewards could be spread out between regions? For instance, a 2 sorcery reward from the Empire, and a 3 sorcery reward from Amaranthia could be used to raise the sorcery track up once (provided it's <=5).

## Mission Creation

Yet another idea for mission creation - separate the locations and achievements in special/standard variants. Prior to playing special locations, some requirements may have to be met. If the requirements are met, up to two special locations may be chosen. Standard locations are drawn in the sandbox mode.

Actually, maybe the following process could be used. (Example is for Imperial mission.)

* Create location decks at the start of the campaign.
* Initially, these consist of only standard locations.
* Draw 6 cards.
   * If you don't have 1 espionage, 1 technology, and 1 sorcery - keep drawing until you do.
   * Could end up with more than 6 cards.
* Choose 5 cards for mission - following requirements for mission region.
   * Amaranthia: Stability, Sorcery, Technology; Empire: Espionage, Technology, Sorcery; Hinterlands: Diplomacy, Military, Technology
* See if locations have any special achievements. If they do, set those aside now.
* Shuffle standard achievement for region and year (early 2-3 difficulty, mid 3-4 difficulty, late 4-5 difficulty).
   * Add standard achievements to special achievements - then shuffle achievement deck.
* See if locations have any special mission cards. If they do, set those aside now.
* Shuffle standard mission cards (20 timer + 20 standard).
   * Add special mission cards to mission deck
* After the mission, check to see if any special locations can be added to the location decks and add them if possible.

## Skill Wheel

Is there a wheel of skill improvements, similar to the wheel of stronghold resources? Doesn't seem as likely. More like using a skill improves the skill.

## Achievements

Aside from improving resource tracks and skills, it could be interesting if each region has a third, more unique, sort of achievement. The Empire could let you burn threat cards, Amaranthia could give you improvements, and the Hinterlands could give you better trade or spotlight locations. Not totally sure about the Hinterlands. Trade adds some complexity that was already taken out. Also, trade doesn't really work the same way. Maybe for now it's spotlight locations? They could particularly be interesting if they have special triggers.

It may also be interesting if achievements are immediately applied. For instance, if an achievement lets you burn a threat card in play - that could open up interesting timing issues. If an achievement burns a location, that would be a little fiddly, since it would take place after the mission and create an exception. But that's probably okay.

## Resource (Society? Kingdom? Council? Stronghold?) Dice

Still iterating over what to call the stronghold stat tracks. Stats, scales, resources. Stat is nice and short, but "stat dice" doesn't maybe sound as nice? Or "stat pool"? Feature. Trait. Rule. Command (already used). Society. Society isn't bad. It's a good word to reflect how the stronghold looks. Also, "society + skill" has a nice ring to it.

The society dice in the pools are raw and unused. They're called pools. Society dice on location cards have been deployed, and are now called assets. The goal of the game is to create enough assets to overcome the current achievements and obstacles.

# 06/24/21

## Location Decks

There are 24 locations in each deck. Location decks have the following resource distribution:

* Resource Breakdowns by Region
   * Each resource has 12 locations total
   * Empire: 6 Espionage, 5 Technology, 4 Sorcery, 3 Military, 3 Stability, 3 Diplomacy
   * Amaranthia: 6 Stability, 5 Sorcery, 4 Military, 3 Technology, 3 Espionage, 3 Diplomacy
   * Hinterlands: 6 Diplomacy, 5 Military, 4 Technology, 3 Espionage, 3 Sorcery, 3 Stability
* Skill Breakdowns by Region
   * Empire
      * 6 Disguise

6 1 3 2 1 5 2 4
2 3 4 2 5 1 4 3
1 5 2 5 3 3 3 2

## Location Setup

May setup as desired, but maiden triggers must be on the left, and crone triggers on the right.

## Mission Construction Option: Campaign

Choose 5 cards based on year, but must have 1 each of the core resources, as in freeform. The first year, there are no choices. That's more of a learning game.

## Mission Construction Option: Sandbox

Draw cards until there are 3 core resources based on region (Amaranthia: Stability, Sorcery, Technology; Empire: Espionage, Technology, Sorcery; Hinterlands: Diplomacy, Military, Technology). Then add in the next 2 cards in the location draw pile, bringing the total to 5.

# 06/22/21

As part of rethinking the mission deck construction, what would happen if locations and achievements were drawn separately? Or maybe achievements were completely isolated from locations? It would certainly make setup quicker. However, it would also make for less strategy. After all, if there was just a big deck of achievements and locations, the ones you were interested in might not come out or could be buried. Even with a way to dig through the deck, that could be frustrating. Also, it seems like some achievements would be much harder than others, and mixing them all together could make for a frustrating experience?

Although, if some of the achievements require sets of dice: that could also be tricky, even with the location being spelled out. After all, there are any number of location types? So, if an achievement says "Stability / Military" - how can you be assured that was possible to fulfill?

## Achievement Dice Combo Options

* 1) Each region has four different fronts, for a total of 12
   * That would guarantee that each front is represented, if you have to use one card for each front
   * Faction: Diplomacy, Military, Espionage, Stability
   * Empire: Espionage, Technology, Sorcery, Military
   * Amaranthia: Stability, Sorcery, Technology, Diplomacy
* 2) Could make it so that each year had a fixed set of four locations
   * Then the achievements could be written with exactly what's present
* 3) Don't refer to specific stronghold dice at all
   * In that case, it's stuff like pairs, progress, full house, set, etc
   * The issue is: that's pretty generic, so much so that it would be hard to even name the achievements
* 4) It's okay if achievements are impossible
   * If so, would have to make it easy to draw a new one

Option 1 isn't very good. It's fun to have all of the possible stronghold dice pools available in different circumstances, and it would be better if these ever become standalone location card decks for an RPG. And 3 is really generic feeling.

The best options are 2 or 4. 4 is okay as long as you don't have to dig forever. May be able to weight them. For example, for Amaranthia missions: mostly stability, then sorcery, then tech, and basically nothing else.

## Mission Construction Option: Total Freeform

In this option, shuffle the location and achievement decks. Draw 4 locations. During the game, may swap out locations as well as achievements.

### Pros

Very quick setup. Lots of uncertainty/possibilities for odd combos of things. (All tech starting deck, etc.)

### Cons

Could have a series of very hard achievements.

## Mission Option: Very Rigid

Each year there are a set of locations you must visit. Achievements are tuned to that.

### Pros

Also quick-ish. No decisions.

### Cons

Doesn't give much flexibility in strategy. For instance, if a location is the tomb where Oniri is trapped - would be nice to visit it later in the game/campaign or maybe not at all, depending.

# 06/21/21

## Mission Construction

The current mission deck is built by taking 10 random mission trigger cards from the region, and adding in the timer cards specified on the chosen location cards. Trigger cards are mostly scenes, twists, and events. Timer cards are mostly obstacles.

Organizing missions around one of three regions does change the trigger alignment some. It used to be pretty clean, with 4 mission types and 4 triggers. Now there are 3 mission types, so should there be 3 triggers? And following that logic, 3 locations? Having 4 locations has seemed like a pretty sweet spot so far. Going up or down from that doesn't seem like it would make things better.

# 06/20/21

## Commitment Options

Previously this was handled by having achievement cards for each character. This did allow quite a bit of customization, however, it's not as flexible.

Maybe the cycles of commitment/discord going up and down are triggered by mission effects, as well as traits, but the result is specific character cards.

So each character does have X discord cards and Y commitment cards. That would let the higher values of those cards really change things up.

That would also restrict achievements to be only tied to mission locations. A little less setup time than if

# 06/19/21

Finished a basic mission deck. The next step is to create a location loader, and label the various locations. The location deck will also filter achievements and mission cards.

It may be the case that the mission deck is created after the locations are chosen? That will probably be the case for the achievements as well?

# 06/18/21

Working on loading character cards into a character deck.

# 06/17/21

Working on a pyqt version of the game for rapid prototyping. First step is to mockup the overall layout.

Finished a mockup of the layout.

# 05/30/21

## Discord Options

Had one idea of using the discord track as a temporary "heated" meter between two characters. Maybe if two characters gain discord, they can't go on the next mission together? A little fiddly, but could be an interesting way to force different combos of characters together. Rather than always teaming up.

## Trait Options

Watch a video on _Fog of Love_ boardgame. It leans really heavily into the character trait concept, which is cool. However, it's probably not a practical way to handle them for _Six Winters_. There are a number of opposing tracks, like Curiosity or Extroversion, and traits are goals in the game - you want the situation to match your trait. So you steer the game towards situations which reward that trait.

Going along that route, traits would be more like achievements. They're a set of tasks that need to happen.

## Dissonant Trait Mechanics

Part of this process is thinking of what sorts of repercussions the disagreements between characters can have. What mechanical ramifications could there be? Is some new mechanical concept needed?

* Discord increases - this one seems very intuitive and is probably the best reprecussion for dissonant traits
* Characters can't work together - that's pretty heavy handed
* Character takes stress - also a possibility
* Discard cards from hand
* Higher difficulty on tests
* Lower resource track - that's pretty brutal

## Compatible Trait Mechanics

* Commitment increases
* Characters work together better
* Remove/lower stress

## Option A: Simple Trait Cards from Mission Deck

There are good and bad trait cards, which can increase commitment or increase discord. Each character has one of each kind of trait, so four trait cards go into the mission deck. When drawn, the cards remain in the player's hand, and apply toward the hand limit. The only way to get rid of them is to play them when in a scene with another character. The positive cards will add to commitment, and the negative ones will add to discord.

### Pros

Easy to understand and implement. They also have very simple to understand effects.

### Cons

There isn't much nuance here. It would be nice if sometimes a trait could be good in one context, but negative in a different one. Conditional traits seem more fun. There is also a pretty limited diversity of options.

## Option B: Double Trait Cards from Mission Deck

Similar to A, but each trait has two cards: one positive and one negative. Still played for discord/commitment.

## Option C: Double Trait Cards with Conditional Play

Have two trait cards for each trait, and each one is conditional on how its used. Some work for specific kinds of scenes. Some are played when a character is alone, etc. This may be the best idea yet, in the sense that all traits become dual natured.

### Pros

This provides much diversity - but could cause problems if the situation doesn't arise. This has been a problem with player cards. If going this route, it should probably be (Common Effect / Bonus Situational Effect), similar to character cards. Otherwise it's just too hard to play them.

Effectively, then, these cards would be character cards, but get placed in the mission deck. Causing them to take up hand space is a great way to force players to play them, thought.

### Cons

Situational effects are very difficult to tune well. And require more reading/cognitive load.

## Thoughts

Don't want these to be super symmetric, though, because then they're just offsetting randomness.

# 05/22/21

What kind of stories should the scenes tell? Maybe that would help? Also, maybe listing how many scenes are in play would help? The pacing desired?

## Example Fiction

* An audience with Arban the Swift, pledging allegience to him in exchange for military aid.
* A costume ball in the Empire - a fancy dress is made - and secrets are learned.
* Crossing a rushing river in the wilderness, using a makeshift bridge. One character aids another and bonds are formed.
* Mana is drawn from the old rock. It corrupts the character who draws it free.
* A festival in town is ruined by old rivalries and a lovers quarrel.

Not sure all of these can be created in the game, but it's useful to brainstorm how they might.

What about, instead of scenes, if they are more like vows? Or perhaps there are vow cards in the game? And you can give a character a vow?

## Very Freeform Version

Could also go even more freeform, which would probably require creating scenes by writing down details on cards. Maybe a player could write something like a vow, _Irownsworn_ style, and then scenes are ways to make progress on vows.

Vows, Bonds, Twists, Scenes, Assets.

# 05/21/21

In general, the idea of using scene cards that remain in play instead of event cards is interesting. However, if too many cards are in play, the deck will basically empty, and for a game that needs the deck to cycle for triggers, that won't work. Probably still need some number of pure event cards. Maybe they should be simple to resolve, though? Manipulating dice, adding stress, moving obstacles around, operating on threats, etc. No skill tests for events.

Another alternative is to use a limit on scenes, so that if a scene is already in play at a location, the drawn card is ignored.

How can scenes be used to craft a narrative? There's a location, a scene, and characters. There are optionally other obstacles. What other components are useful for a narrative? Relationship? Need? Objects? Maybe brainstorm how these could be used, if they can be used at all. Could possibly have relationship cards, either character cards, or cards from the mission deck. For instance, siblings or lovers or business partners. No idea how/if that would work into the narrative, though. That doesn't feel like something for scenes. Rather, it feels like something that could exist between player characters.

## Option: Specific Scenes

* Scene: Costume Ball
* Location: Secret Gardens
* Need: Impress the Duke, Bake a Cake, Get Information
* Object: Fancy Dress
* Modifier: Raining, At Night, In the Winter, Faux Pas
* Relationship: ?

The relationships don't seem to work so well here. Scenes and locations are pretty obvious. Need/scene is _probably_ the same as well. A scene has a need. Objects make sense, though. Perhaps brainstorm scenes. They can probably come from WotA directly - tons of them there.

### Example Scenes

* Cross a River
* Costume Ball
* Hunting Trip
* Difficult Travel
* Hacking through Vines
* Raging River
* Climbing over Rocky Crags
* Brutal Cold

It's very hard to have scenes like this flexible enough to apply to different mission types.

## Option: Vague Scenes

This option would hew closer to WotA. A scene might be "Risky Escape" or something like that. Scenes could have skills, difficults, and stress. Maybe they could interact with other obstacles and locations present?

What would the success/fail consist of, though? Scenes would probably need triggers to make them interesting. Without triggers, it may be that players never want to deal with them.

There's also the case that having tons of scenes in the progress deck would mean scenes come out _constantly_. And there would basically be a scene at every location, which could get overwhelming. At that point, the other cards really would need to be events or something like that.

If the scenes were vauge, could easily have modifier cards. Objects, conditions, weather, characters, etc. This is more like oracles as well - in games like _Ironsworn_ or _Mythic_.

# 05/19/21

Thinking now about going back to skill tests, but circling in the society stats as well. This would lean heavily into the dice elements. Much of the dice games consists of a system of generators --> modifiers --> receivers, in a loop.

* Generators: skills, resources, achievements, character cards
* Modifiers: character cards
* Receivers: obstacles, achievements, character cards

## Overcome Obstacle

Obstacle Description

* Name
* Type: **Skill + Resource**
* Difficulty: **1-6**
  * Skill dice must be this high to be a success
* Challenge: **1+**
  * How many successes are needed
* Stress Type: <Mental, Physical>
* Stress Amount: **0+**
  * Damage done after every skill test (if not taken out) or to stop trigger
* Trigger (optional)
  * What the obstacle will do if triggered
* Weakness (optional)
  * Special dice combos that will trigger more stress or fuel effects

Working Together  

* If more than one character works together, it still only takes one action - players roll their dice independently
   * However, stress applies to ALL characters making the test

Overcome Procedure

* Roll skill dice
* Apply stress

## Create Advantage

Is something like this possible? Probably not as a separate action. In this game, this just feels like something handled with cards.

## Sample Character Cards

Core Actions:

* Split a die
* Join two dice
* Reroll a die
* Duplicate a die
* Gain a die of a certain type
* Cause stress directly
* Exchange dice
* Trade dice
* Swap out 1 die for other dice
* Defense
* +1
* -1
* Flip die

Bonus Actions:

Most of the above actions could also qualify for bonus actions. The key thing with bonus actions is that they would be tied to specific skills, resources, or characters (including being with another character).

* Draw a card

## Sample Obstacles

Obstacles are things like guards, monsters, issues, scenes. Characters overcome these directly.

## Sample Achievements

Character card, fortune-at-the-front options. The current pattern of draw a card and adding it to a skill is kind of boring. Even misses are a little boring, because there are four actions, so it's not even inconvenient. However... missing or losing your turn is a boring complication.

One option is to allow players to play cards directly from their hand. Or, maybe choosing a careful approach from their hand or a risky approach from the deck.

## Option: Careful/risky skills + cards have symbols

In this option, character cards have the following symbols in the upper right hand corner: Success, Mental Stress, Physical Stress, or Discord. They all have at least one of these symbols, but could have more. For isntance, a card could have 2 success symbols.

A player can make a skill test carefully. In this case, they play at least one card from their hand that has a success symbol. The number of success symbols are added to their skill value for the result.

A player can also make a risky test. In this case, they draw cards from the deck up to their skill value (they choose the number before drawing). Every symbol adds one to the skill test, no matter what the symbol is. However! If a mental stress icon comes up, they take mental stress equal to the total number of symbols. If a physical stress symbol comes up, they take physical stress equal to the total number of symbols. And if a discord symbol comes up, they take discord equal to the total number of symbols.

### Pros

It seems more intersting than what's there now. Players can control their destiny more, but there's also an option to really swing for the fences and take lots of consequences in order to get a high result.

### Cons

The risky approach may not be swingy enough. For instance, if there's usually 1 symbol on every card, you kind of know the result. It would be nice if the risky approach could really suck or really be amazing. Also, if the risky card draw is only up to their skill amount, it doesn't open up the really long shot chance with a crappy skill. It would be nice if some really risky skill test is possible, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Additionally, the conservative approach may not work quite right if you must play a card each time you would like to do a skill test. Skill tests are pretty common: it's possible that multiple times a turn players would like to do a skill test. With limited hand sizes, that becomes tricky. At that point, it's probably necessary to draw up to the hand size each turn. That may make it more feasible?

### Analysis

Hand sizes are based on Stability, but could be from 1-6, most likely around 2 or 3. Skills are currently 0-6. Target numbers should be based on dice ranges: 0 is the lowest result possible, with 12 being the very high end.

### Suboptions

* Spending a card is optional for careful use of skills. That would clearly make it easy to use skills carefully. A character with a skill of 6 could basically grab one die each turn. That does feel a little dry, though.

There's always a tension between streamlining systems and offering enough variety that different thematic components in the game feel different. There are various thematic elements in Six Winters: community building, fighting monsters, exploring, breaking into vaults, casting spells, building developments, sneaking past guards, making smalltalk, negotiating.

The key components in the game are the resource dice as well as the deck of character cards.

Dice manipulation options:

* Sets of dice types
* Sets of dice values
* getting specific values of resources
=======
* Specific dice values
* Evens
* Odds
* Totals

Card manipulation options:

* Play cards from hands for numeric totals
* Play cards that match certain symbols/tags
* Use cards as "processing units" for dice types

## Threat Mechanics

Threats are played as:

* Locations (go in one of the threat locations)
* Attachments to locations (must play the type of location if possible)
* Attachments to characters
* Obstacles (would need to go to one player's mission area, for general types of threats)

Threat effects are either:

* Effects that are ongoing
* Effects that occur when a certain progress trigger happens
* Effects that occur at the end of the season
     * This option doesn't generate as much pressure as the others

## Threat Triggers

As it stands now, triggers occur only on locations you're actually at. For obstacles, they occur broadly. They also occur on attachments attached to characters. Do they occur on all attachments generally?

Maybe they should just occur on all obstacles / attachments / locations? The "you have to be there" was to make it easier to scan over cards, but it makes threat design tough? Maybe all the locations / attachments / obstacles in the player's mission area as well as the spotlight area will activate.

## Red Bank Tests

It would be nice if the threats weren't necessarily a guaranteed occurrence. One way that could happen is via a trigger causing a dice roll. These might be special sorts of tests where things like mana couldn't be used (since mana requires a caster and backlash). Something like, "Rare: Red Bank Test: Espionage 3. Success: Blah. Failure: Blah." Might be worth having that as a generally available test type?

On thinking about it more, this probably isn't necessary. The "not a guaranteed occurrence" can probably be handled by triggers. Although, the triggers are doubled, so need to take that into account.

## Threat Effects

* Lower resources
* Lower resource tracks
* Lower secrets
* Increase discord
* Increase apotheosis
* Give conditions
* Lower disposition
* Broad effects (no mana for spells, etc)

## Threat Ideas

* Military threats
   * Could "burn" Red Bank locations so that the location cards almost function as a hit points as such for badness
* Bandits
* Building a wonder to keep up with the Empire
   * Gardens of the Pomegranates
* Assassination
* Werewolf infection
* Pandemic
* Magical Backlash
