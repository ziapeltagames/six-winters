#  Eastkeep / North Oaks Season One Playtest

Played through an infiltration mission (Eastkeep) and an exploration mission (North Oaks). Used one threat which started in play. There were some very interesting strategic decisions that emerged. But there were still some points that felt a little slow.

# Roses

Thought it was pretty fun to involve the resource game more. Could see doing even more of that.

# Thorns

The big ones: the faction disposition tracks and the society tracks could still be used more, the hindrance values didn't come into play enough. Also still not sure about mission pacing. It's better, but having multiple mission paths is pretty fiddly and doesn't really change things _that_ much.

## Involving Tracks More

This is probably the easiest to fix. These tracks should be used more in missions, on developments, and in starting locations. For example, instead of trading 3:1, could trade 3:disposition. Could use stability to remove conditions instead of a character condition, etc.

## Hindrance Not Used Enough

Tried something where the obstacles in the staging area don't apply their hindrance. That made it so they never really do. Instead, it might be good to have obstacles move to locations where characters are if they're activated.

## Player Season End

It might also be nice if one of the characters can perform actions at non-mission locations after they leave the mission. So they can do _something_. That's a little fiddly given that most of the cards won't apply, but it would keep a player in the game for a bit until the other player is done, performing more of a support role.

## Pacing / Encounter Deck

The pacing still felt a little off. Not sure having multiple missions paths really helps all that much. It does provide some choice, but there's quite a bit of overhead. Wondering about having one mission path you can complete, an encounter deck you can work through with random stuff, and then a miscellaneous goal. That still works within the framework fine. It would shift the choice to draw a card from the progress deck to just a draw.

Or maybe the player can draw as many encounter cards as they want? That doesn't seem like a good idea. It could really slow the game down.
