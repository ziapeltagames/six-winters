# Trait Idea

This might provide another way to customize characters beyond lifepath and discord cards. These would be broad tags that could be assigned to characters, like headstrong or careful. They would show up on encounter cards and let characters make unique sorts of choices.

## Implementation Difficuties

Would need to come up with a list of traits beforehand. Probably in the 7-10 range? The best time to assign these might be during interludes. Putting them on encounter cards is probably the best spot for them. Putting them on locations could get pretty messy.

However, putting them on encounters makes them pretty random. Through the luck of the draw, you could certainly control none of the characters that have a particular trait. Not sure if there's a way around that? It's not ideal to have some cards that do nothing, though. Maybe they can do X thing, but if a character in the group has a trait, they do Y thing?
