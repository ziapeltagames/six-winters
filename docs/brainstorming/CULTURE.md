Notes on culture and trade from ~1200s central Asia.

"Spectacular buildings were erected in the huge cities of Babylon, Persepolis, Pasargadae and Susa, where King Darius built a magnificent palace using the highest-quality ebony and silver from Egypt and cedar from Lebanon, fine gold from Bactria, lapis and cinnabar from Sogdiana, turquoise from Khwarezm and ivory from India."

"The most famous and valuable mounts were bred in the Fergana valley to the far side of the spectacular Pamir mountain range that straddles what is now eastern Tajikstan and north-eastern Afghanistan. Much admired for their strength, they are described by Chinese writers as being sired by dragons and are referred to as hanxue ma or 'sweating blood' - the result of their distinctive red perspiration that was caused either by a local parasite or by the horses' having unusually think skin and therefore being prone to blood vessels bursting during exertion."

"Diplomatic envoys typically accompanied large caravans bringing goods for trading, which then returned home with products that were sought after at home - including Red Sea pearls, jade, lapis lazuli and consumables such as onions, cucumbers, coriander, pomegranates, pistachios and apricots. Highly desirable frankincense and myrrh, which in fact came from Yemen and Ethiopia, were known in China as Possu - that is, Persian goods. As we know from one later source, the peaches of Samarkand were considered immensely valuable: 'as large as goose eggs' and with a famously rich color to them, they were known in China as 'Golden Peaches'."
