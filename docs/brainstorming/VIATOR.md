Viator’s charm

“Why, but of course. Tonight is a night to be merry – worries should be left at the door. A small little town like Redbank can cause no disturbance here.”


Viator’s sympathy

“Every city is of importance. Lily Manor will do everything in its power to aid Redbank. Any kingdom, large or small, is deserving of peace.”
