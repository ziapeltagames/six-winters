Brainstorming about how the final mission should play out.

# Overview

The Animaelic Forest is a psychic map of the Autarch's internal pain. It's a place where time doesn't exist in the normal fashion. The player's will go through what the Autarch has gone through, while also dealing with their own insecurities and petty hatreds, which are amplified there. It would be nice if the lifepath cards, discord cards, possibly traits (if they're used) all come into play. 

## Movement

Seems like you shouldn't be able to move between spotlight locations. Maybe you don't even use spotlight locations at all? You go in with developments and artifacts, and no longer juggle threats are anything of that nature.

Having one shared encounter deck and shared locations might be the easiest way to handle this. So, no threats, no spotlight locations, just the animaelic forest location and encounter deck.

On the other hand, players will be pruning spotlight locations and coming up with a strategy that leverages. Changing that at the end might really ruin any sort of momentum there. Thematically it might be weird, but gameplay is more important - should probably leave things unchanged as much as possible!

* Current decision: leave the spotlight locations alone, but let characters move freely between mission locations (everyone is on the same mission).

## Discord

Not sure if discord should work the same way re: overflow. Normally a character gets a discord card which is unlocked after the mission. However, this is most likely the last mission. Could immediately put the card in the deck, or could do something different. One option might be that a character is permanently killed when discord overflows. That might give it more of the feel of a finale. Learning towards that.

It would also be cool if the discord characters have comes into play somehow. Maybe some cards can come out representing their worst selves, and the difficulty of getting rid of it depends on a character's current discord?

## Threats

Drawing a threat should probably do something else. Maybe adding discord? Or - perhaps the year six threats reflect the Apotheosis the Autarch has gained, and really, really suck. Then, if apoth happens earlier, can just use year six threats for the remainder of the game.

# Obstacles

If movement is more fluid, how should obstacles be handled? If all of these are shared, it would effectively double the number of triggers. Maybe that's appropriate here? Obstacles are basically twice as difficult? In that case, there would be one shared staging area, and all the locations would effectively be shared as well. The downside is that obstacles trigger basically twice as much, but that might be fine for a finale.

# Locations

The locations might be more abstract, reflecting emotions and feelings that the Autarch has.

## General Locations

* Despair
* Anger
* Safety
* Authority

# Mission Path

One longer mission path, like a quest, which both players work on together, might be more appropriate here? With lots of obstacles and bad locations coming into play that make this difficult.

## Autarch Trials

* Pass the Trial of Burning Copper in the Harrowing
* Defend against Guild of Security Bullies
* Stay still during the Ritual of Purity
* Defeat Or'thak, the beast of one thousand eyes
* Defend Arcus from Plainsman Raiders

It may culminate in a showdown with the shadow of the Autarch

## The Hive Memory

Implanting memories into the Autarch
Changing the past and future

# Apotheosis

It should be more difficult if the apotheosis has happened. One possibility is to use threats to make this more difficult. Perhaps these threats can be broad, global effects that make success more difficult.

# Encounters

* Twisted dopplegangers
* Maybe feature cards that take advantage of discord, leading to some tough choices? Minor breakdowns might amplify and cause one character to lash out at another one

# Personal Demons

What could come up for players? Obstacles? Locations? Encounters?

Might be nice to have these things be a little more persistent, so locations or encounters. But what would be an example?

Could also just have encounter cards that do something based on a character's discord. For example, place more discord out, or make something more difficult, give a character a condition, etc.

## Location

The difficulty could be based on discord? While the theme is a more general darkness the character must confront. Oniri might be called back to the underworld. A location might not be right, though, because it isn't something that generally has a broad effect (although it probably could). Then you could burn progress equal to the character's discord.

## Obstacle

"Ghosts of the Past", Hindrance: 2, Lore Difficulty equal to Oniri's discord.

## Attachment

These could be attached to different characters. This might be a good approach. In this case, it might be possible to attach the card to a different character.

## Character Backgrounds

To make all of this work, it's important to really flesh out the backgrounds for the characters. This is going to partly be done through lifepath cards and maybe darkness cards?
