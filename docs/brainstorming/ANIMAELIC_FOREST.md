Brainstorming about how the final mission should play out.

# Overview

The Animaelic Forest is a psychic map of the Autarch's internal pain. It's a place where time doesn't exist in the normal fashion. The player's will go through what the Autarch has gone through, while also dealing with their own insecurities and petty hatreds, which are amplified there.

## Movement

Seems like you shouldn't be able to move between spotlight locations. Maybe you don't even use spotlight locations at all? You go in with developments and artifacts, and no longer juggle threats are anything of that nature.

Having one shared encounter deck and shared locations might be the easiest way to handle this. So, no threats, no spotlight locations, just the animaelic forest location and encounter deck.

On the other hand, players will be pruning spotlight locations and coming up with a strategy that leverages. Changing that at the end might really ruin any sort of momentum there. Thematically it might be weird, but gameplay is more important - should probably leave things unchanged as much as possible.

## Discord

Not sure if discord should work the same way re: overflow. Normally a character gets a discord card which is unlocked after the mission. However, this is most likely the last mission. Could immediately put the card in the deck, or could do something different. One option might be that a character is permanently killed when discord overflows. That might give it more of the feel of a finale. Learning towards that.

It would also be cool if the discord characters have comes into play somehow. Maybe some cards can come out representing their worst selves, and the difficulty of getting rid of it depends on a character's current discord?

## Threats

Drawing a threat should probably do something else. Maybe adding discord? Or - perhaps the year six threats reflect the Apotheosis the Autarch has gained, and really, really suck. Then, if apoth happens earlier, can just use year six threats for the remainder of the game.

# Locations

The locations might be more abstract, reflecting emotions and feelings that the Autarch has.

# Mission Path

One longer mission path, like a quest, which both players work on together, might be more appropriate here? With lots of obstacles and bad locations coming into play that make this difficult.

## Autarch Trials

* Pass the Trial of Burning Copper in the Harrowing
* Defend against Guild of Security Bullies
* Stay still during the Ritual of Purity
* Defeat Or'thak, the beast of one thousand eyes
* Defend Arcus from Plainsman Raiders

It may culminate in a showdown with the shadow of the Autarch

## The Hive Memory

Implanting memories into the Autarch
Changing the past and future

# Apotheosis

It should be more difficult if the apotheosis has happened.

# Encounters

* Twisted dopplegangers
* Maybe feature cards that take advantage of discord, leading to some tough choices? Minor breakdowns might amplify and cause one character to lash out at another one
