# Types of Achievements

There are number of types of achievements that could be put into play.

* Spending Resources
* Buy Developments
* No Obstacles of Type / Name X in Play
* Defeat an Obstacle - These
* Buy a Development
* Fulfill a Condition

### Brainstorm

Not sure if buying something that has an effect should count as "spending resources"? Probably not. This is spending resources solely in fulfillment of the achievement.

Achievements that are for taking out a specific obstacle are tricky. If the obstacle is in play at the start of the mission, it undermines the nature of card based achievements, since the obstacle could be tackled without the achievement being in play. But only being able to remove the obstacle without the achievement in play doesn't seem good at all, either. Probably the best option is to have "locked" obstacles that come into play when the achievement card does. That preserves the trade off of deciding when to tackle the achievement.
