# Character Cards

Ideas for character cards, motivation, and discord.

# Motivation

Currently, there are motivation cards for each character. Do they need to be more general? If a card is for character X and they aren't on the mission, what happens? Could discard it, which is probably the easiest approach. Or it could be burned.

Maybe some motivation cards could be general, such that any character could tackle them? Then again, that brings up weird things where a team of characters could make progress on it. And they're supposed to be solo sorts of efforts. One way around that is to attach them to a character.

## Ideas

Thea: Card that reinforces she does better when focusing on one thing at a time? Oniri maybe has one that reflects handling multiple things at once?
