There's always a tension between streamlining systems and offering enough variety that different thematic components in the game feel different. There are various thematic elements in Six Winters: community building, fighting monsters, exploring, breaking into vaults, casting spells, building developments, sneaking past guards, making smalltalk, negotiating.

The key components in the game are the resource dice as well as the deck of character cards.
