# 08/16/21

Need to move toward a full playtest. Too many unknowns in the streamlined playtest version. Will do quick versions of achievements, locations, and obstacles.

# 08/13/21

## Playtest Notes

* Already vastly better with increased pools and skills as well as achievement difficulties.
   * The main thing: number of dice for an achievement and pool size need to be fairly closely aligned.
* The "combo achievement" option is also pretty cool.
   * Although, it may require some careful sequencing - probably should collect all achievements prior to refilling the achievement deck.
* May need dice limits on locations as well.
* Achievements still feel a little too easy.
   * Also, should they cost actions to complete?
   * They're still a little weird, given they aren't attached to a location.

## Playtest Prep

* One more time doing restricted region playtest - although not going to get too much info from this.
* Iterated once on the character cards, added some variety.
* Will have resource pools of 3.
* Will add 1 to all the character skills.
* Going to iterate once on the achievements as well.

## More Achievement Notes

One of the things about fixed numbers is the difficulty in adjusting dice. Cards can do it, but there's no action that does it. Maybe if enough cards can do it, it may not be a big deal. But that could be a vote more in favor of totals or patterns like "pair", which are both far more flexible.

## Card Movement Costs

One option is to put movement costs on each site card for the cost to move _to_ the site.

So, like, Empire: 2, Red Bank: 3, Settled Lands: 4. Or Empire: 1, Red Bank: 3, Settled: 3, etc. You could even have a "can't move" there icon, or a special tag for port locations, etc.

# 08/12/21

## Next Playtest

Event though it's not ideal to play only one region - may give it another go with some tweaks to the achievements, character cards, skills, and dice pools.

### Skills and Pools

For now, going to add 1 to all the skills and starting resource pools. That will give characters more dice to work with.

### Character Cards

Going to ignore the conditional character cards for now. That may honestly end up being too high of a cognitive load, anyway.

## Patterns and Obstacles

There are different potential patterns in the game, both for obstacles and achievements. Might be worth really streamlining these. Achievement patterns are kind of all over the map. But obstacles might be narrower.

* Defense/progress consists of many lower valued dice.
* Attacks consist of fewer high valued dice.

So, strikers should be good at splitting dice, while attackers are better at merging dice/+1. Rerolls are pretty universal, as are exploding dice and flips.

Could also have explicit defense and strike cards, based on type of defense or type of obstacle. A little less elegant, though.

### Achievements

* Sets of Colors
   * Any X colors
   * Specific colors: red green blue or blue blue red, etc
   * For now, specific colors would be better
   * Low numbers would be preferred, as they're easier to get
   * Cards: -1, reroll, flip
* Sets of Numbers
   * Any set of X matching numbers
   * Specific numbers: 2 2 2 or 3 3 or even 2 2 3 3
   * Cards would be useful either way, depends on the range of numbers, although split seems particularly useful
* Set of Specific Dice (Color + Number)
* Total Value
   * Better to have high numbers
   * Cards: +1, merge, flip
* Total Value of Multiple Colors
* Sequence of Numbers

Could probably get pretty far with: lists of colors, lists of numbers, and total. The number of dice, types of dice, and values would all contribute to difficulty.

Considering how much of the game is a pattern matching exercise, it'd kind of be cool if there was a way to overlap achievements. As in, maybe when you spend dice, you pool them up - and you can cash in as many achievements as are applicable? That could be really interesting. Probably doesn't work very well with "totals", but definitely could work if there are numbers and colors.

That would incentivize players to invest tons of dice for big spends. Not sure if that's good or bad. If there's a way to mess with invested dice with obstacles... could be pretty interesting.

# 08/11/21

## Playtest Notes

* For this session, going to have two achievements, because there's only one region
   * Base difficulty is all the stars added together
   * In the future, may only have one achievement per region (so three achievements going at the same time)
* Having only one die in a resource pool is very constraining
   * Particularly if a card operates on more than one die of a resource type, won't help if there aren't multiple dice
* Similarly, having a skill of 0 is constraining, because there's no "beginner's luck"
* Both Fuscus and Keel have similar cards so far

## Exchange and Achievements

Wondering if there's a way to simultaneously bring exchange into the game, and make for more flexible achievements. Achievements need certain resources (this is good), and locations have different resources (also fine), but, it's possible for there to be a mismatch between locations and achievements. It'd be nice if there was a way to exchange resources out. Maybe an exchange action can switch out a raw resource *or* an invested one. That would let players, say, get a resource die they need for an achievement even if they don't have a location with that resource. Not a bad idea. However, it could encourage stagnation. After all, if investing is 1 - you could just invest, exchange, invest, exchange, etc. Why move locations?

Would make sorcery interesting - because it goes to everything, but nothing goes to it. So would really want at least one sorcery location in the game, or wouldn't be able to fill those achievements.

## Discord/Commitment Economy

The other tricky part - in moving toward an open movement environment, is that each player doesn't really own their discord pool. Perhaps when the pool overflows it raises one character's discord, rather than all of their discord? Or, could go the other extreme - each character has their own pools. That's even more fiddly, though. Having global pools is interesting. Will go with that for now, and see how it goes.

## Action Economy

Using action points is interesting - and makes movement more impactful, but not sure what a good system is. Maybe 1 to overcome and 1 to invest, and 2 to move?

* Move - Varies (see card)
* Invest - 1
* Overcome - 1
* Exchange - 1/die (related resource for location, or any invested die)
   * Swap out the die for the next one on the exchange track
   * If sorcery, swap out for any die
* Cooperation - Add highest discord
* Location Action - Varies

## Threat Option 2

Like the idea of threats happening if 3 or more symbols match. Any threats with those three matching symbols hit one of the resource tracks.

Really not sure about the all or nothing overcome approach for threats. It would be pretty frustrating to not be able to do anything - that's one of the red flags. So leaning towards having each threat able to be overcome independently. Players will tend to get rid of any that have 2 matching, but that's part of the strategy!

# 07/28/21

## Character Card Abilities

* Split a die
* Merge two dice
* Reroll a di(c)e
* Duplicate a di(c)e
* Gain a di(c)e of a certain type
* Cause stress directly (Attack)
* Exchange di(c)e in resource pools
* Swap out 1 die for other dice (6 --> 2 ones)
* Defense
* +1
* -1
* Flip die
* Exploding dice
* Exploding dice by type (sorcery)
* Immediate effects: sorcery backlash, discord, etc, based on traits

Most of these seem pretty straightforward, although gaining a die seems tricky? Where would it go? Can you just drop it on a location? Doesn't seem quite right. Will probably skip that for now.

## Spotlight Locations

Maybe some locations have special actions (trade, recover stress, etc) that take some amount of action points. It would make it a little cleaner - cards wouldn't have to be split up so much.

## Trade

Probably needs to be driven by cards. Could also be a location action. It could also be an option all the time - but that gets a little cumbersome, and it seems like it would distract from the game. How would it work if it's from a card? Is it limited by a resource type? As in, Thea can exchange into or out of Stability? Or is it open ended trading from any resource to any resource. The problem with using cards is that it will be fairly limited, and limited it even more by not allowing trading from anywhere could be an issue.

Or maybe you can trade as an action while on a related resource location? Or from a Red Bank location?

## Card Play

Most cards modify dice. They may be played during a test. Even this is tricky - for example, if you have a +1 card, can you play it on a resource die, and then not take the resource die? Essentially modifying what's in the pool? That's one step away from just letting players play cards whenever.

You may only play cards during a test: can play them on either skill dice or resource dice. Seems cleaner at that point to allow cards to modify skill dice or resource dice matching the location type.

Maybe obstacles don't have resource dice types? Was already headed that way - and that would make this rule much cleaner. Would that get wonky? Maybe not. Some obstacles might be fixed at a location, so the resource die would be fixed. Cards that move could change what's useful - guards could be Disguise + Stability or Disguise + Espionage. This changes the fiction, how the guard is overcome in the narrative. But it would probably make sense still. And then card play is very clean: test dice or resource dice either invested at the location or from the pool matching the location type. That lets players modify invested dice and resource pool dice. The key point: you do have to be at the location, so movement would matter.

## Tests (Overcome)

* Roll skill dice
* Allocate resources from related pool
   * Each skill die may take one resource die if skill die >= resource die
* Allocate invested resource
   * Resources at site character is located at may be invested freely
* Cards may be played as desired

## Tests (Invest)

* Roll skill dice
* Allocate resources from related pool
   * Each skill die may take on resource die if skill die >= resource die
* Cards played as desired

## Invested Resources

Can players modify invested resources? How? One valid option is to make it impossible, although that could be somewhat frustrating and limit options.

* Can't change invested resources
   * Easiest to remember via rules, but it could result in resources not getting used
* Any card can be used to change invested resources
   * High cognitive load
   * Makes the spatial game matter much less
* May only play cards at dice at character's location
   * This isn't a bad option, a little fiddly on the rules front
* Cards are explicitly for invested resources
   * Really limited ability - not going to be used very often
* Can change invested resources during a test
   * Also okay, but becomes more about the test?

# 07/25/21

* Finished the region and character deck programs
* Need to come up with some initial rules for card limits

## Threat Brainstorming

Unifying the threat deck makes sense in the 9 location version of SW. But it would be nice if threats had their own flavor - beyond just the ability to lower resource tracks. The one nice thing about the earlier threat pattern: threats weren't tied to the same cycle of timers, and it was somewhat unclear when they would trigger. Getting rid of twists, and using threats in their place could be interesting. What if threats are just placed at locations, like they were before for spotlight locations? Since each location is tied to a resource, the threat could attack the resource of the attached location.

### Threat Option 1

Get rid of twists, and there are 13 or 14 threat cards in the mission deck. They have different backs, making it easier to distinguish them. They enter play face down at the site. Getting rid of them is based on current difficulty. But you need a number of successes equal to the number of threats, you can't do partial successes. If the location triggers, you flip over the threat cards. If the total is higher than the defense of the location, your resource track goes down.

### Pros

Threats don't all happen during the same bust phase. Any track is susceptible to a threat.

### Cons

Seems like they could trigger pretty frequently, if a timer causes them to flip. So, perhaps counterintuitively, if stages advance and more triggers are drawn, will make it less likely threats reach a higher value. Also makes threats a little less thematic. No variety in how to overcome threats.

# 07/16/21

## Next Steps

* Make a computer program that can represent one region - random locations, a draw deck, a timer discard, and an achievements deck.

Things to look for: how many obstacles, scenes, and threats should be attached to a site? Is there a limit? Does there need to be? Are threats a kind of scene?

## Three Region Rules Option 2

Might be able to have location cards and achievements come from one unified deck. Obstacles is quite a bit harder, though. Some sites could certainly be generic, while some could be tagged to regions. Achievements are also, in some sense, already broader than one region. They could span multiple regions.

## Three Region Rules Option 1

This option leans pretty heavily on there being different sites, obstacles (scenes, threats, foes, traps, issues, diplomats), and achievements for each region.

* Start play
   * There are 9 fixed locations, 3 in each region for each of the different triggers, at the start of the campaign
   * There three decks of 10 achievements for each region
   * There three decks of 20 mission cards for each region
* During play
   * Refill resource pools
   * Refill hand to 3 cards
   * Take actions
      * Players take actions in order
   * Triggers - each player activates one for each region in which they have a character
      * Each region has its own timer track for the three phases - if the trigger matches the current phase, it advances
      * If it moves off of the waning phase, the timers activate and the season advances
      * When winter comes, the year is immediately over
   * Encounters
* After play
   * Spend achievements to advance tracks as desired
      * May spend spotligh achievements to draw spotlight locations
      * May spend threat achievements remove threats from any single deck (starting with weakest threat)
   * Each player draws a new location (10 new draws), a new achievement (10 new draws), and a new threat
      * Discard down to 9 locations and 10 achievements per region
      * The threats are added to the decks listed on the front of the card

### Pros

Little more intuitive to create content - can be more thematically tied to situation. There's also a little more prediction there, because certain regions will tend to have certain kinds of obstacles, scenes, and achievements.

### Cons

Going to be fiddly to maintain the different decks, for sure.

## Three Region Achievemnt Cards Option 1

The first choice is a single deck of achievements - that perhaps changes over time. Players don't have much control over this. This isn't great, though, because the players don't have a way to focus on going after certain tracks.

## Three Region Site Cards Option 1

One nice thing about a three region version: could probably enforce choosing sites such that every possible resource die is covered. So, achievements would be able to require anything.

* Amaranthia: Stability, Sorcery
* Empire: Espionage, Technology
* Hinterlands: Diplomacy, Military

Each region could start with a small set of cards to choose from - with players needing to choose at least one of each of those types. Maybe you can lay out the board somewhat randomly - but then be deliberate about choosing developments? That's a possibility.

## Three Region Site Cards Option 2

Could also be the case that site cards don't have resources tied to them at all. Instead, there could be slots on map for certain types of resources.

## Three Region Verion

Really thinking hard about switching from each player having one of two regions, to each player going to all the regions at once. Would this mean one giant deck of sites, obstacles, and achievements? It could. Although, they're so themed around regions - having separate decks may make more sense. At least for obstacles. It's possible sites could be generic enough to fit anywhere. Although, you would probably need certain sites based on their resource dice.

### Pros

It kind of solves the nagging feeling that movement doesn't matter as much. It also makes for a clean world map - no more weirdness from spotlight locations or other things like that. It _could_ mean more co-operation, not sure.

### Cons

Of course, the timers and achievements would require lots of thinking to tune correctly. There's also the chance one player dominates the game, because both players actions would be far more intertwined.

## Event Card Rethink

Have been thinking about event cards. Not sure they're all that interesting, compared to other cards. They're also very fortune-at-the-front, which I've been trying to avoid. One option is to make them more predictable, so that each mission type has a kind of event which happens more frequently.

Another thought is to maybe swap them out with threats. It would be nice to not have one more deck of cards (the campaign deck), if possible. Although, the campaign deck is currently kind of cool. If they are threats - they'd need to be able to build in severity over time. And the way the campaign deck can form a strategy for the Empire is also cool. That's tough to duplicate in the mission deck without a decent amount of setup.

## Mission Deck Threat Option 1

One option is for each of the three regional mission decks to change over time. That would match the site and achievement decks. For that to work, though, some cards would need to come out somehow, and some cards would need to be added somehow. But it is interesting - in the sense that each region could have their own individualized and changing "threats" and "theme" over the campaign. For that to work, though, cards have to leave the deck somehow - and enter the deck somehow. That's particularly tricky to do while maintaining a rough balance of timers to triggers. One option is that only threat cards enter and leave that way.

At the beginning of the campaign, each regional deck starts with certain cards in it - including the threats. At the end of each session, random threat cards are added to each deck. These grow in severity over time. Threat cards can be removed by spending achievements - some achievements let you tune your regional deck.

### Pros

Should be easier to set up / tear down, since each deck tracks its own state. So when you start play, can just shuffle and go. It also meets the criteria of threats which get harder over time, as well as having a different focus (for instance, Military, etc).

### Cons

Worried about dilution of other event types. Although, this could be fixed with rough number of timer/trigger cards for threats. The other issue is that threats could grow to dominate the deck. Of course, if they're bad enough - that would be motivation to use achievements to pull them out.

It's also a little weird that going to a certain region changes where the threats are coming from.

## Mission Deck Threat Option 2

In this option, there is a pool of threat cards that changes over time. At the end of each session, new threats are added to this pool. Then, the threat cards are divided up into each deck for that mission.

### Pros

Has a more general "threat" agenda for the Empire - rather than the slightly weirder mix of threats from each region deck.

### Cons

Way more fiddly. Have to pull all of them out at the end of the game, add new ones, and shuffle them in again. Kind of a pain. There's also potentially strategy in having different regions have different kinds of threats.

## Threat Rethink

Thinking of getting rid of events (some of these events will get offloaded to character abilities - which makes more sense), and having threats go back to being mission cards, along with obstacles, scenes, and twists. How would a threat work, though? Is it more like a scene? More like an obstacle? Could you have multiple threats attacking the same resource track going at once?

Threats feel more like obstacles than scenes, in the sense there probably should be multiple threats that can happen at once. The easiest is to give them all bust conditions that will lower a resource track. That way they can linger for a bit - but then activate if there's a bust. That does mean there's a conservative way to play, where you advance the stage yourself - and try not to bust. But, that could also mean the threat doesn't get discarded - so it'll be a dangerous way to play in the final phase. Also, if threats are shared, the bust could get triggered from either player?

Players do get the opportunity to work against the threats, though - so it's somewhat workable. It's also less fiddly than trying to do a countdown with progress or something like that. Which is a pain.

This means there wouldn't be defenses for spotlight locations anymore. And maybe there aren't even spotlight locations? This change would definitely ripple out. It does make sense, probably, to have threats be at a neutral location.

# 07/14/21

What's the structure of an obstacle card? Was thinking of having a defense section, which consists of various patterns of dice and progress numbers. Achievement cards are the means by which obstacles and scenes scale over time. However, they could add to the difficulty, the progress, or the defense. Progress may be the best of the three. It's nice because too high of a defense is boring, there would be too many failures. Somewhere around 3 or 4 is the sweet spot. Too much higher or lower isn't great.

However, there's some weirdness going that route. If the obstacle progress changes between turns, a scene or obstacle could be completed when it isn't the players turn! Hmm. That's kind of strange. Attack or defense is cleaner in that sense.

Should all scenes and obstacles have the same basic defense, then? Equal to the current difficulty? If they do, there's no reason to put that onto cards.

## Obstacle/Scene Legend

They all have a standard defense for one progress equal to the current mission difficulty. Then they have optional patterns for additional progress. Finally, they have optional patterns for stress, discord, and other effects. The progress amounts and stress effects do not vary. It could be nice to vary stress - but for now will try to use fixed amounts.

## Splits, Merges, Even, Odd, Fixed

Going forward with obstacles and scenes, it could be cool to match up attack, defense, and obstacle types with certain patterns of dice. That would allow characters to be better/worse at certain types of obstacles without making it explicit. For instance, high numbers (merge), could be more common for defense. While pairs (splits) could be better for attacking and making progress.

Could even have low numbers be useful in some contexts.

## Common Patterns

There are generators and patterns. Patterns accept dice and generate either more dice or other effects.

* Achievements
   * Have a wide variety of patterns, don't usually generate anything else
   * Always typed by one or more resource
   * Total+: Adds up to the listed total
   * Single+: The most common, matches a single die of the value or higher
   * Single-: Matches a single die of the value or lower
   * Single+ Type1, Single+ Type2, etc
   * Pair: Pair of two different types
   * Three of a kind: Three of a kind of three different types (hard!)
   * Set: A set of any value of the listed types of dice
* Obstacles
* Scenes

## Obstacle Movement

Another wrinkle: there are now multiple locations with the same trigger type in play. That can wreak havoc for sequencing activations of obstacles. It used to be that only one location would activate during each trigger phase. Now there could be two or even three. This is mainly an issue for movement.

You almost have to do: move all obstacles that can move. Then activate all spaces. Or do it the other way around: activate then move. But if it's by space, the sequencing is kind of a nightmare. Or you could have an entirely different movement phase.

Were would a movement activation come from? Could put movement icons on the back of the trigger deck. Previously, experimented with an "acitve" scene that handled movement, based on icons. In some ways, it is nice to not clutter up cards with movement stuff. But there is no longer one active scene.

Could always do the back of mission cards. Or could do achievement cards. Doing the back of mission cards would give played _a lot_ of info, so that's not ideal. When would obstacles move? Maybe at the start of each round.

# 07/07/21

Brainstorming standard mission deck.

## Differentiating Obstacles

Should give some thought to differentiating obstacles. Particularly scenes vs. other kinds of obstacles. As it stands, they're all very similar, except that scenes don't move. But that doesn't feel like enough of a difference. Scenes could also be more variable - that is, some scenes give you benefits for overcoming them, while the other obstacles are primarily negative. In WotA, scenes are how you progress to the end of the mission. Here, though, that's driven by timers.

Maybe scenes can focus more on number of characters? Solo scenes, group scenes, etc? That could be a tag - how many characters are allowed in the scene.

There's also the question of whether these scenes are needed at all. In some sense, achievements are like scenes. Just longer scale scenes. In RPGs, scenes are the core unit of play - they highlight how characters grow and change over time. Perhaps scenes can focus more on discord, commitment, harmony - characters working together or growing apart? Does that make sense? And other kinds of obstacles can perhaps focus on stress or progress more.

Although, trait cards were focusing more on discord and commitment.

## Mission Deck: Brainstorming Twists

In this version, there are obstacles, scenes, twists, and events. Scenes are basically obstacles. Could probably work them into that framework. The main difference is that scenes don't move around, and go away at various points in the game, while other obstacles only go away when they're overcome.

Twists attach to locations, scenes, or obstacles. They typically add additional skills or resources to the base version. They could also increase/decrease difficulty, add tags, add conditions, add additional activations, or busts. This is a way to give obstacles more variety.

Whether or not they're on separate cards is mainly a pacing issue. Will need to playtest to figure out if there are too many/too few obstacles. If twists are on separate cards, they'll probably be discarded frequently because there is nothing to attach them to. However, if obstacles cards have two sections, one for the scene and one for a twist, there would be many twists in play - perhaps too many. It also makes the cards busier.

# 07/04/21

Also need to revisit the achievement terminology. There are lots of potential options, but some of them may not be very interesting.

* Total value of any number of dice
* Total value of a specific type of dice
* Total value across specific types of dice
* Specific types of dice
* Unique types of dice (Set?)
* Specific values of dice
* Matching values of dice (Pair? Triple? X-of-a-kind?)
* Matching values across unique types of dice
* Overcoming obstacles

# 07/03/21

Following the idea of using a flexible/decoupled achievement deck, next step is to create the set of standard achievement cards.

## Achievement Brainstorming

Can standard achievements be burned? Or does the standard imply that they're always the same. Kind of feels like the latter. It does seem nice to have a chance for weirder achievements, though, without special locations.

Standard locations should probably be able to add special achievements, as well as special mission cards. And then those achievements may be burned, which could have consequences.

Yet another option is a fairly deep well of achievements. But if they're related to difficulty - that's kind of a backwards pattern. They would basically get easier over time as they're filtered out - which isn't quite right.

Better to add more difficult achievements in over time. Maybe that justifies the use of some standard achievements that my be burned? For now, standard achievements can't be burned and don't have larger impacts on the world.

## Mission Deck Construction Brainstorming

There are currently four types of mission cards. Standard/Special X Spotlight/Timer. Requirements: deck has a rough ratio of timer:trigger cards, locations will need starting obstacle cards on them occasionally, and achievements may need special obstacle cards.

### Mission Deck: Option One (Fixed Standard Deck)

In this option, the standard deck is always a fixed set of cards. Special cards could be added to the deck, but all the standard cards are always played. This makes for a very quick setup, if the standard cards are delineated in some way. In this case, the starting cards on locations would all be special.

### Mission Deck: Option Two (Build Standard Deck)

In this option, there are more standard cards than needed. The first step is to add cards to the various locations, and then add cards to the mission deck as described by locations. Finally, a certain number of mission cards are counted out. Clearly, much more fiddly. It does allow for more randomness in the standard deck, however. It also opens the door to have a bigger threat: a dragon, undead, The Autarch, etc. And an achievement could remove them from the deck. Or change it over time.

### Pros/Cons

It's easy enough to start using the first option, because it's quicker, and move to the second if something is too limiting. Really, one of the only patterns that's impossible is certain cards in the deck that go away because of mission results. That is, an adapative mission deck. It also _could_ be too predictable if the same cards keep coming out.

Actually, could bring in weird creatures via achievements as well. For instance, there could be a zombie plague achievement. And if the Tomb is destroyed - it gets burned. That kind of "back doors" in the monsters. Also, the source of the undead could be hinted at on the location card.

## Undari's Tomb Brainstorming

Thinking of options for one particular location to help flesh out design patterns.

### Undari's Tomb: Option One (Special Loc)

Undari's Tomb is a special location. So it must be found via other achievements, and then adding it to the Amaranthia location deck. When chosen, it has a special achievement to kill the Necromancer there. If the Necromancer is killed, Oniri is unlocked. It also has some special mission cards - to add undead to the location and to the deck.

### Undari's Tomb: Option Two (Common Loc)

Undari's Tomb is already available. Same as above, but don't have to search for it. The nice thing about searching for it - it's nice to have a 1:1 between special locations, special achievements, and special mission cards.

### Undari's Tomb: Option Three (No Special Mission Cards)

In this option, there are no undead mission cards just for this location. They're already in the mission deck. However, this mission would have a way to burn all of the undead from the game. This is an interesting way to have the mission deck adapt over time.

### Pros/Cons

The special/not special location isn't that big of a deal. The real issue may be how the mission deck is constructed. It's important for each region mission deck to have a rough ratio of timer to non-timer cards.

## Unlocking Characters 

Unlocking new characters probably shouldn't involve spending these achievements. Rather, it may be a good use of special achievements. Need to flesh out how these special achievements work.

# 06/25/21

## Types of Cards

* Mission Cards: Standard/Special, Spotlight/Timer, Event/Obstacle/Scene/Twist
* Achievement Cards: Standard/Special
* Location Cards: Standard/Special, Empire/Amaranthia/Hinterlands, Wilderness/Urban/Rural/Dungeon/Vault/Tavern
* Character Cards: Standard/Discord/Commitment/Trait
* Campaign Cards: Threat/Quiet/Development

## Trade

One big question: is trade a thing?

## Achievement Breakdown

Empire

3 Espionage
2 Espionage
2 Sorcery
4 Technology
4 Disguise
3 Lore
4 Thievery
3 Combat
2 Threat
3 Threat

## Achievement Categories

Besides resource tracks, skills, and manipulating the threat deck, what other points are there?

Developments? Should there even be developments? It's a WotA thing - but there's also plenty already going on. How would they work? Would you add them to the campaign deck? Spotlight locations? Similar thing there - are those worthwhile? Would they have a cost? How does trade factor in?

Unlocking characters may make sense. Maybe unlocking locations?

Empire: Threats
Amaranthia: Developments
Hinterlands: Locations (Using this approach - the special locations would be locked, and would have costs?)

## More Achievement Ideas

Another achievement idea, besides 1 Achievement : 1 Reward, is some kind of set collection approach. Maybe they're currencies? Like, if you want to raise the Stronghold's Espionage track to 3, you have to spend 3 Espionage achievements. You would need a ton of achievements to make that work, though.

Actually, if there are 10 early, 10 mid, and 10 late achievements, could put a specific mix of achievements into the deck.

1 Espionage, 1 Technology, 1 Disguise, 1 Thievery, 1 Combat, 1 Lore, 3 Threats. + Special Achievements
1 Stability, 1 Sorcery
1 Diplomacy, 1 Military

Problem with the 1:1 achievement approach and deckbuilding, is that it could become pretty easy to raise tracks. For example, 1 Stability and 1 Sorcery or something like that. There's also the situation that, in actual play, it's probably rarely the case that you would skip an achievement or make any kind of decision based on the reward. Kind of can't see that happening. Which is why rewards were decoupled in the first place. Although decoupled rewards have the downside that resource tracks are vastly more important than skill tracks. So having hard rewards gets around that.

Could definitely have a bigger achievement deck, and you choose random achievements. However, 10 track increases seems like... a lot. What's the right number?

It's around 1 resource track achievement, and maybe 2 or 3 skill achievements, along with a threat achievement. That's only 4 or 5 cards for the 1:1 achievements. Which sure isn't many. They'd need to be pretty tough to make the challenging. But having achievements out for a long time is also kind of boring and static.

Could divide achievements into resource track, skill, and special rewards. Adding up points for each of those is kind of fiddly, but that would work, I suppose.

Raising a resource track = X points
Raising a skill track = X points
Special rewards = X points

Actually - that might be kind of cool? It's certainly fiddly, but it could be interesting. For instance, sorcery rewards could be spread out between regions? For instance, a 2 sorcery reward from the Empire, and a 3 sorcery reward from Amaranthia could be used to raise the sorcery track up once (provided it's <=5).

## Mission Creation

Yet another idea for mission creation - separate the locations and achievements in special/standard variants. Prior to playing special locations, some requirements may have to be met. If the requirements are met, up to two special locations may be chosen. Standard locations are drawn in the sandbox mode.

Actually, maybe the following process could be used. (Example is for Imperial mission.)

* Create location decks at the start of the campaign.
* Initially, these consist of only standard locations.
* Draw 6 cards.
   * If you don't have 1 espionage, 1 technology, and 1 sorcery - keep drawing until you do.
   * Could end up with more than 6 cards.
* Choose 5 cards for mission - following requirements for mission region.
   * Amaranthia: Stability, Sorcery, Technology; Empire: Espionage, Technology, Sorcery; Hinterlands: Diplomacy, Military, Technology
* See if locations have any special achievements. If they do, set those aside now.
* Shuffle standard achievement for region and year (early 2-3 difficulty, mid 3-4 difficulty, late 4-5 difficulty).
   * Add standard achievements to special achievements - then shuffle achievement deck.
* See if locations have any special mission cards. If they do, set those aside now.
* Shuffle standard mission cards (20 timer + 20 standard).
   * Add special mission cards to mission deck
* After the mission, check to see if any special locations can be added to the location decks and add them if possible.

## Skill Wheel

Is there a wheel of skill improvements, similar to the wheel of stronghold resources? Doesn't seem as likely. More like using a skill improves the skill.

## Achievements

Aside from improving resource tracks and skills, it could be interesting if each region has a third, more unique, sort of achievement. The Empire could let you burn threat cards, Amaranthia could give you improvements, and the Hinterlands could give you better trade or spotlight locations. Not totally sure about the Hinterlands. Trade adds some complexity that was already taken out. Also, trade doesn't really work the same way. Maybe for now it's spotlight locations? They could particularly be interesting if they have special triggers.

It may also be interesting if achievements are immediately applied. For instance, if an achievement lets you burn a threat card in play - that could open up interesting timing issues. If an achievement burns a location, that would be a little fiddly, since it would take place after the mission and create an exception. But that's probably okay.

## Resource (Society? Kingdom? Council? Stronghold?) Dice

Still iterating over what to call the stronghold stat tracks. Stats, scales, resources. Stat is nice and short, but "stat dice" doesn't maybe sound as nice? Or "stat pool"? Feature. Trait. Rule. Command (already used). Society. Society isn't bad. It's a good word to reflect how the stronghold looks. Also, "society + skill" has a nice ring to it.

The society dice in the pools are raw and unused. They're called pools. Society dice on location cards have been deployed, and are now called assets. The goal of the game is to create enough assets to overcome the current achievements and obstacles.

# 06/24/21

## Location Decks

There are 24 locations in each deck. Location decks have the following resource distribution:

* Resource Breakdowns by Region
   * Each resource has 12 locations total
   * Empire: 6 Espionage, 5 Technology, 4 Sorcery, 3 Military, 3 Stability, 3 Diplomacy
   * Amaranthia: 6 Stability, 5 Sorcery, 4 Military, 3 Technology, 3 Espionage, 3 Diplomacy
   * Hinterlands: 6 Diplomacy, 5 Military, 4 Technology, 3 Espionage, 3 Sorcery, 3 Stability

6 1 3 2 1 5 2 4
2 3 4 2 5 1 4 3
1 5 2 5 3 3 3 2

## Location Setup

May setup as desired, but maiden triggers must be on the left, and crone triggers on the right.

## Mission Construction Option: Campaign

Choose 5 cards based on year, but must have 1 each of the core resources, as in freeform. The first year, there are no choices. That's more of a learning game.

## Mission Construction Option: Sandbox

Draw cards until there are 3 core resources based on region (Amaranthia: Stability, Sorcery, Technology; Empire: Espionage, Technology, Sorcery; Hinterlands: Diplomacy, Military, Technology). Then add in the next 2 cards in the location draw pile, bringing the total to 5.

# 06/22/21

As part of rethinking the mission deck construction, what would happen if locations and achievements were drawn separately? Or maybe achievements were completely isolated from locations? It would certainly make setup quicker. However, it would also make for less strategy. After all, if there was just a big deck of achievements and locations, the ones you were interested in might not come out or could be buried. Even with a way to dig through the deck, that could be frustrating. Also, it seems like some achievements would be much harder than others, and mixing them all together could make for a frustrating experience?

Although, if some of the achievements require sets of dice: that could also be tricky, even with the location being spelled out. After all, there are any number of location types? So, if an achievement says "Stability / Military" - how can you be assured that was possible to fulfill?

## Achievement Dice Combo Options

* 1) Each region has four different fronts, for a total of 12
   * That would guarantee that each front is represented, if you have to use one card for each front
   * Faction: Diplomacy, Military, Espionage, Stability
   * Empire: Espionage, Technology, Sorcery, Military
   * Amaranthia: Stability, Sorcery, Technology, Diplomacy
* 2) Could make it so that each year had a fixed set of four locations
   * Then the achievements could be written with exactly what's present
* 3) Don't refer to specific stronghold dice at all
   * In that case, it's stuff like pairs, progress, full house, set, etc
   * The issue is: that's pretty generic, so much so that it would be hard to even name the achievements
* 4) It's okay if achievements are impossible
   * If so, would have to make it easy to draw a new one

Option 1 isn't very good. It's fun to have all of the possible stronghold dice pools available in different circumstances, and it would be better if these ever become standalone location card decks for an RPG. And 3 is really generic feeling.

The best options are 2 or 4. 4 is okay as long as you don't have to dig forever. May be able to weight them. For example, for Amaranthia missions: mostly stability, then sorcery, then tech, and basically nothing else.

## Mission Construction Option: Total Freeform

In this option, shuffle the location and achievement decks. Draw 4 locations. During the game, may swap out locations as well as achievements.

### Pros

Very quick setup. Lots of uncertainty/possibilities for odd combos of things. (All tech starting deck, etc.)

### Cons

Could have a series of very hard achievements.

## Mission Option: Very Rigid

Each year there are a set of locations you must visit. Achievements are tuned to that.

### Pros

Also quick-ish. No decisions.

### Cons

Doesn't give much flexibility in strategy. For instance, if a location is the tomb where Oniri is trapped - would be nice to visit it later in the game/campaign or maybe not at all, depending.

# 06/21/21

## Mission Construction

The current mission deck is built by taking 10 random mission trigger cards from the region, and adding in the timer cards specified on the chosen location cards. Trigger cards are mostly scenes, twists, and events. Timer cards are mostly obstacles.

Organizing missions around one of three regions does change the trigger alignment some. It used to be pretty clean, with 4 mission types and 4 triggers. Now there are 3 mission types, so should there be 3 triggers? And following that logic, 3 locations? Having 4 locations has seemed like a pretty sweet spot so far. Going up or down from that doesn't seem like it would make things better.

# 06/20/21

## Commitment Options

Previously this was handled by having achievement cards for each character. This did allow quite a bit of customization, however, it's not as flexible.

Maybe the cycles of commitment/discord going up and down are triggered by mission effects, as well as traits, but the result is specific character cards.

So each character does have X discord cards and Y commitment cards. That would let the higher values of those cards really change things up.

That would also restrict achievements to be only tied to mission locations. A little less setup time than if

# 06/19/21

Finished a basic mission deck. The next step is to create a location loader, and label the various locations. The location deck will also filter achievements and mission cards.

It may be the case that the mission deck is created after the locations are chosen? That will probably be the case for the achievements as well?

# 06/18/21

Working on loading character cards into a character deck.

# 06/17/21

Working on a pyqt version of the game for rapid prototyping. First step is to mockup the overall layout.

Finished a mockup of the layout.

# 05/30/21

## Discord Options

Had one idea of using the discord track as a temporary "heated" meter between two characters. Maybe if two characters gain discord, they can't go on the next mission together? A little fiddly, but could be an interesting way to force different combos of characters together. Rather than always teaming up.

## Trait Options

Watch a video on _Fog of Love_ boardgame. It leans really heavily into the character trait concept, which is cool. However, it's probably not a practical way to handle them for _Six Winters_. There are a number of opposing tracks, like Curiosity or Extroversion, and traits are goals in the game - you want the situation to match your trait. So you steer the game towards situations which reward that trait.

Going along that route, traits would be more like achievements. They're a set of tasks that need to happen.

## Dissonant Trait Mechanics

Part of this process is thinking of what sorts of repercussions the disagreements between characters can have. What mechanical ramifications could there be? Is some new mechanical concept needed?

* Discord increases - this one seems very intuitive and is probably the best reprecussion for dissonant traits
* Characters can't work together - that's pretty heavy handed
* Character takes stress - also a possibility
* Discard cards from hand
* Higher difficulty on tests
* Lower resource track - that's pretty brutal

## Compatible Trait Mechanics

* Commitment increases
* Characters work together better
* Remove/lower stress

## Option A: Simple Trait Cards from Mission Deck

There are good and bad trait cards, which can increase commitment or increase discord. Each character has one of each kind of trait, so four trait cards go into the mission deck. When drawn, the cards remain in the player's hand, and apply toward the hand limit. The only way to get rid of them is to play them when in a scene with another character. The positive cards will add to commitment, and the negative ones will add to discord.

### Pros

Easy to understand and implement. They also have very simple to understand effects.

### Cons

There isn't much nuance here. It would be nice if sometimes a trait could be good in one context, but negative in a different one. Conditional traits seem more fun. There is also a pretty limited diversity of options.

## Option B: Double Trait Cards from Mission Deck

Similar to A, but each trait has two cards: one positive and one negative. Still played for discord/commitment.

## Option C: Double Trait Cards with Conditional Play

Have two trait cards for each trait, and each one is conditional on how its used. Some work for specific kinds of scenes. Some are played when a character is alone, etc. This may be the best idea yet, in the sense that all traits become dual natured.

### Pros

This provides much diversity - but could cause problems if the situation doesn't arise. This has been a problem with player cards. If going this route, it should probably be (Common Effect / Bonus Situational Effect), similar to character cards. Otherwise it's just too hard to play them.

Effectively, then, these cards would be character cards, but get placed in the mission deck. Causing them to take up hand space is a great way to force players to play them, thought.

### Cons

Situational effects are very difficult to tune well. And require more reading/cognitive load.

## Thoughts

Don't want these to be super symmetric, though, because then they're just offsetting randomness.

# 05/22/21

What kind of stories should the scenes tell? Maybe that would help? Also, maybe listing how many scenes are in play would help? The pacing desired?

## Example Fiction

* An audience with Arban the Swift, pledging allegience to him in exchange for military aid.
* A costume ball in the Empire - a fancy dress is made - and secrets are learned.
* Crossing a rushing river in the wilderness, using a makeshift bridge. One character aids another and bonds are formed.
* Mana is drawn from the old rock. It corrupts the character who draws it free.
* A festival in town is ruined by old rivalries and a lovers quarrel.

Not sure all of these can be created in the game, but it's useful to brainstorm how they might.

What about, instead of scenes, if they are more like vows? Or perhaps there are vow cards in the game? And you can give a character a vow?

## Very Freeform Version

Could also go even more freeform, which would probably require creating scenes by writing down details on cards. Maybe a player could write something like a vow, _Irownsworn_ style, and then scenes are ways to make progress on vows.

Vows, Bonds, Twists, Scenes, Assets.

# 05/21/21

In general, the idea of using scene cards that remain in play instead of event cards is interesting. However, if too many cards are in play, the deck will basically empty, and for a game that needs the deck to cycle for triggers, that won't work. Probably still need some number of pure event cards. Maybe they should be simple to resolve, though? Manipulating dice, adding stress, moving obstacles around, operating on threats, etc. No skill tests for events.

Another alternative is to use a limit on scenes, so that if a scene is already in play at a location, the drawn card is ignored.

How can scenes be used to craft a narrative? There's a location, a scene, and characters. There are optionally other obstacles. What other components are useful for a narrative? Relationship? Need? Objects? Maybe brainstorm how these could be used, if they can be used at all. Could possibly have relationship cards, either character cards, or cards from the mission deck. For instance, siblings or lovers or business partners. No idea how/if that would work into the narrative, though. That doesn't feel like something for scenes. Rather, it feels like something that could exist between player characters.

## Option: Specific Scenes

* Scene: Costume Ball
* Location: Secret Gardens
* Need: Impress the Duke, Bake a Cake, Get Information
* Object: Fancy Dress
* Modifier: Raining, At Night, In the Winter, Faux Pas
* Relationship: ?

The relationships don't seem to work so well here. Scenes and locations are pretty obvious. Need/scene is _probably_ the same as well. A scene has a need. Objects make sense, though. Perhaps brainstorm scenes. They can probably come from WotA directly - tons of them there.

### Example Scenes

* Cross a River
* Costume Ball
* Hunting Trip
* Difficult Travel
* Hacking through Vines
* Raging River
* Climbing over Rocky Crags
* Brutal Cold

It's very hard to have scenes like this flexible enough to apply to different mission types.

## Option: Vague Scenes

This option would hew closer to WotA. A scene might be "Risky Escape" or something like that. Scenes could have skills, difficults, and stress. Maybe they could interact with other obstacles and locations present?

What would the success/fail consist of, though? Scenes would probably need triggers to make them interesting. Without triggers, it may be that players never want to deal with them.

There's also the case that having tons of scenes in the progress deck would mean scenes come out _constantly_. And there would basically be a scene at every location, which could get overwhelming. At that point, the other cards really would need to be events or something like that.

If the scenes were vauge, could easily have modifier cards. Objects, conditions, weather, characters, etc. This is more like oracles as well - in games like _Ironsworn_ or _Mythic_.

# 05/19/21

Thinking now about going back to skill tests, but circling in the society stats as well. This would lean heavily into the dice elements. Much of the dice games consists of a system of generators --> modifiers --> receivers, in a loop.

* Generators: skills, resources, achievements, character cards
* Modifiers: character cards
* Receivers: obstacles, achievements, character cards

## Overcome Obstacle

Obstacle Description

* Name
* Type: **Skill + Resource**
* Difficulty: **1-6**
  * Skill dice must be this high to be a success
* Challenge: **1+**
  * How many successes are needed
* Stress Type: <Mental, Physical>
* Stress Amount: **0+**
  * Damage done after every skill test (if not taken out) or to stop trigger
* Trigger (optional)
  * What the obstacle will do if triggered
* Weakness (optional)
  * Special dice combos that will trigger more stress or fuel effects

Working Together  

* If more than one character works together, it still only takes one action - players roll their dice independently
   * However, stress applies to ALL characters making the test

Overcome Procedure

* Roll skill dice
* Apply stress

## Create Advantage

Is something like this possible? Probably not as a separate action. In this game, this just feels like something handled with cards.

## Sample Character Cards

Core Actions:

* Split a die
* Join two dice
* Reroll a die
* Duplicate a die
* Gain a die of a certain type
* Cause stress directly
* Exchange dice
* Trade dice
* Swap out 1 die for other dice
* Defense
* +1
* -1
* Flip die

Bonus Actions:

Most of the above actions could also qualify for bonus actions. The key thing with bonus actions is that they would be tied to specific skills, resources, or characters (including being with another character).

* Draw a card

## Sample Obstacles

Obstacles are things like guards, monsters, issues, scenes. Characters overcome these directly.

## Sample Achievements

# 05/16/21

Character card, fortune-at-the-front options. The current pattern of draw a card and adding it to a skill is kind of boring. Even misses are a little boring, because there are four actions, so it's not even inconvenient. However... missing or losing your turn is a boring complication.

One option is to allow players to play cards directly from their hand. Or, maybe choosing a careful approach from their hand or a risky approach from the deck.

## Option: Careful/risky skills + cards have symbols

In this option, character cards have the following symbols in the upper right hand corner: Success, Mental Stress, Physical Stress, or Discord. They all have at least one of these symbols, but could have more. For isntance, a card could have 2 success symbols.

A player can make a skill test carefully. In this case, they play at least one card from their hand that has a success symbol. The number of success symbols are added to their skill value for the result.

A player can also make a risky test. In this case, they draw cards from the deck up to their skill value (they choose the number before drawing). Every symbol adds one to the skill test, no matter what the symbol is. However! If a mental stress icon comes up, they take mental stress equal to the total number of symbols. If a physical stress symbol comes up, they take physical stress equal to the total number of symbols. And if a discord symbol comes up, they take discord equal to the total number of symbols.

### Pros

It seems more intersting than what's there now. Players can control their destiny more, but there's also an option to really swing for the fences and take lots of consequences in order to get a high result.

### Cons

The risky approach may not be swingy enough. For instance, if there's usually 1 symbol on every card, you kind of know the result. It would be nice if the risky approach could really suck or really be amazing. Also, if the risky card draw is only up to their skill amount, it doesn't open up the really long shot chance with a crappy skill. It would be nice if some really risky skill test is possible, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

Additionally, the conservative approach may not work quite right if you must play a card each time you would like to do a skill test. Skill tests are pretty common: it's possible that multiple times a turn players would like to do a skill test. With limited hand sizes, that becomes tricky. At that point, it's probably necessary to draw up to the hand size each turn. That may make it more feasible?

### Analysis

Hand sizes are based on Stability, but could be from 1-6, most likely around 2 or 3. Skills are currently 0-6. Target numbers should be based on dice ranges: 0 is the lowest result possible, with 12 being the very high end.

### Suboptions

* Spending a card is optional for careful use of skills. That would clearly make it easy to use skills carefully. A character with a skill of 6 could basically grab one die each turn. That does feel a little dry, though.

# 05/15/21

There's always a tension between streamlining systems and offering enough variety that different thematic components in the game feel different. There are various thematic elements in Six Winters: community building, fighting monsters, exploring, breaking into vaults, casting spells, building developments, sneaking past guards, making smalltalk, negotiating.

The key components in the game are the resource dice as well as the deck of character cards.

Dice manipulation options:

* Sets of dice types
* Sets of dice values
* getting specific values of resources
=======
* Specific dice values
* Evens
* Odds
* Totals

Card manipulation options:

* Play cards from hands for numeric totals
* Play cards that match certain symbols/tags
* Use cards as "processing units" for dice types

# 06/02/18

## Threat Mechanics

Threats are played as:

* Locations (go in one of the threat locations)
* Attachments to locations (must play the type of location if possible)
* Attachments to characters
* Obstacles (would need to go to one player's mission area, for general types of threats)

Threat effects are either:

* Effects that are ongoing
* Effects that occur when a certain progress trigger happens
* Effects that occur at the end of the season
     * This option doesn't generate as much pressure as the others

## Threat Triggers

As it stands now, triggers occur only on locations you're actually at. For obstacles, they occur broadly. They also occur on attachments attached to characters. Do they occur on all attachments generally?

Maybe they should just occur on all obstacles / attachments / locations? The "you have to be there" was to make it easier to scan over cards, but it makes threat design tough? Maybe all the locations / attachments / obstacles in the player's mission area as well as the spotlight area will activate.

## Red Bank Tests

It would be nice if the threats weren't necessarily a guaranteed occurrence. One way that could happen is via a trigger causing a dice roll. These might be special sorts of tests where things like mana couldn't be used (since mana requires a caster and backlash). Something like, "Rare: Red Bank Test: Espionage 3. Success: Blah. Failure: Blah." Might be worth having that as a generally available test type?

On thinking about it more, this probably isn't necessary. The "not a guaranteed occurrence" can probably be handled by triggers. Although, the triggers are doubled, so need to take that into account.

## Threat Effects

* Lower resources
* Lower resource tracks
* Lower secrets
* Increase discord
* Increase apotheosis
* Give conditions
* Lower disposition
* Broad effects (no mana for spells, etc)

## Threat Ideas

* Military threats
   * Could "burn" Red Bank locations so that the location cards almost function as a hit points as such for badness
* Bandits
* Building a wonder to keep up with the Empire
   * Gardens of the Pomegranates
* Assassination
* Werewolf infection
* Pandemic
* Magical Backlash
