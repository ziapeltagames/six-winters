# 9/3/2018 - Obstacles stay at locations

As it stands now, the hindrance mechanics aren't really engaged at all. Even one hindrance is too much. So, obstacles are typically in the staging area, or they're at a location and a character is trying to take them out. So something should be reworked.

It may be the case that a staging area isn't really needed at all. Instead, obstacles just show up at locations and stay there (barring some special character advancement card). Exploring these rules, obstacles would either show up at various mission locations in a pre-programmed way, or they would go to the current mission path location.

Some design goals:

* The total number of obstacles should matter. It's probably no good if you can just let obstacles go and not think about them.
* There should be reasons to take out obstacles, but also reasons to leave them alone.
* Obstacles should be able to impact a few economies: mainly discord and mission progress, but possibly other less common things like resources, apotheosis, or fortune.

There are probably plenty of ways to achieve this goal.

## Obstacles have a single danger or peril value, triggered by timer cards.

Fleshing this idea out, obstacles will just have one value, most likely in the range of 3-7.

### All discord applies

On the timer cards, there will be triggers for discord as well as mission progress. If discord triggers, you would add up all the danger on the obstacles that are currently in play, and take that much discord. If mission progress triggers, you would look at the current mission path location, and lose progress based on all the obstacles that are there.

The big problem with this variant is that discord losses would be very high, because there would be more obstacles not at mission path location than at mission path locations.

### Only at locations where characters are

This would lower the amount that triggers - but then there could be lots of obstacles in play that really aren't threatening characters, which goes against a key design goal.

### Discord is number of obstacles

This would lower the amount of discord, and may even scale pretty well. It would also mean the number of obstacles in play is a problem, although not a severe one in low numbers. If there are 1-5 obstacles out, that maps pretty well to a lower discord pool maximum, like 8 or so. Letting lots of them pile up wouldn't be great.

Then the peril could really be something which hinders progress, and only progress. If the value is lower, it would be frustrating, but not super irritating. Could also have a defend mechanic as well.

So, obstacles would have a trigger which lowers progress and can be defended against. Discord would also hit against the number of obstacles in play. Some obstacles may also have another trigger, which would apply to special effects. Might be able to just get away with one batch of triggers, though, since lots of obstacles wouldn't need dedicated triggers anymore.

## Obstacles have different values for discord and mission progress

This might work, but it's kind of fiddly, considering almost all of the obstacles would need a very low value for discord, nearer to one. At that point, may as well just count up the number of obstacles.
