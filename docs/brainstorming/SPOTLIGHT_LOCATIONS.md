# Overview

Brainstorming about different sorts of spotlight location abilities, and which mission they should appear in.

There should be one (or more) location abilities that raise each of the fifteen tracks in the game. Five resource tracks, five society tracks, and five faction disposition tracks. More than likely, the resource track increases should be found in exploration missions. The society tracks found in alliance missions. Society tracks can be sprinkled around elsewhere.
