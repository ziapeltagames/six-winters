# Asset Deck Construction

As it currently stands, there are quite a few situational cards which can get tied up in player's hands. One thought is to make the asset deck more like a regular deck building game - such that you start drawing again when it's cleared out. To make that work, cards must be either discarded or played frequently.

## One Card Limit

Having only one asset card at a time may allow for two things: it's easier to keep track of what your card does, and it forces you to either play it or discard it to churn faster. The cards could also be a little more complex.

Players could choose what developments to put in their decks, but taking the character cards would be mandatory. That also gives a bottom end to how much you could realistically cycle your deck. If each character has two cards that can't be burned, it would mean there's at minimum a four card cycle in place. So you would probably only see the same development at most three or so times. That allows for some deck building ideas, but probably prevents less fun corner cases like a deck size of one.

## New Advancement Cards

Using this model, there would always need to be *some* advancement cards that can't be burned or churned through. That way the deck size is at some minimal level. The particular development abilities will also help.

When a new year comes along, then, it will probably be the case that you have to take all of the new advancement cards for the character. That wouldn't allow customization at that level, like in developments. That may be okay. If it's possible to burn some advancement cards, it may be more of a game to decide when and how to make that happen. You could burn some of those cards in order to shrink your deck and use developments more.

# Deck Building

Currently the game doesn't include fully fleshed out deck building. In a standard deckbuilding game, the deck is the engine, and it builds up over time, with more of some sort of currency being generated. The progress deck right now has a series of triggers and timers, which control both how long the game takes and what sort of events happen. It might be nice to split them all up. So there is only one trigger on each card, possibly with one timer as well.

Into this mix are added developments and character cards. However, there's really no downside to adding these cards. In fact, you would always add all of your developments. In a standard deckbuilding game, these developments would be what generates currency (whatever that is - resources or what have you). In a standard deckbuilder, you would burn some of the cards that aren't doing as much for you.

The problem with doing a standard deckbuilder with Six Winters is that you can't burn the cards with triggers or timers on them, because it would be super easy to throw the whole deck out of whack. The timers are critical for pacing missions.

## Questions

* Why would you voluntarily leave developments out of a deck, or burn other developments?

If developments are always good, and other cards are always bad, you probably would never leave out developments. The burn effects on developments may motivate you to burn them for something even better. But otherwise, you're going to leave them in. Typically, tuning your deck, either by leaving stuff out or burning things, occurs if you have low value cards, along with some high value cards. You'll either leave out the low value cards or burn them. In this case, the cards of low value are triggers and timers. And it's not really possible to burn them. You would always choose to burn timers, since those end the season.

If there were also triggers on developments, that would make you more likely to burn them. That said, you could seriously skew those probabilities if they could be burn or modified. It seems like, in general, if you have a deck of "bad stuff" as it were, you can't really modify that.

You could have two decks: one for the progress cards and one for developments. Then you would want to tune the development decks. However, it gets back to having lots of different decks, which isn't great. Encounter deck, developments deck, and progress deck (with character cards). The benefit is that you might think more about the actual deckbuilding elements of the cards. That said - if the progress deck is what drives pulling cards, there will always be an issue of having various numbers of "draw development" cards in the progress deck. They would have to continually be added.

However, it could be the case that by simply paying for the various developments and having interesting burn options, there may be enough there to make for interesting choices.

## Option: Development Deck, Progress Deck (+ Character Cards), Encounter Deck

In this case you could either draw one development each turn, or you could have a location card which features a "draw development" ability. That does tie up actions for quite some time, though. For maybe nothing that interesting.
