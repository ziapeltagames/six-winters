# Showdowns

Each chapter ends with a showdown. A showdown is a two pronged mission, intended to showcase stronger interactions between missions than are present during a regular session. Additionally, the achievements have **types** associated with them. The resolution of the showdown is based on how many of each type are collected during the session. There are three showdowns in the campaign. At the end of years two, four, and six.

## Interactions

Since both missions of the showdown are known, there is an oppotunity to have interactions between obstacles and cards from each mission. These are general patterns that might be used.

* Trade-off: In this pattern, an effect for mission A could be positive, while it could be negative for mission B. Removing the effect depends on the situation. This could also be done with a threat, where more progress helps mission A but hinders mission B.
* Conditional Chain: In this situation, an obstacle for mission A might need to be dealt with prior to the removal of an obstacle at mission B. This only becomes interesting if there is a different pressing situation at mission A that needs to be handled.
* Remote Action: Actions at mission A could have a more direct impact for mission B. Adding or removing progress, making tasks easier or harder.

### Brainstorm

It most likely will not be possible to lose a showdown in the traditional sense. Six Winters is far more of a narrative experience than an optimization experience. But the consequences for the showdown should be stronger than for a regular mission, and should involve Red Bank to a larger degree, rather than only focusing on characters.

# The First Showdown

The first showdown has two missions, **Tragedy and Conspiracy**, set in Red Bank, and **Whispers at Lily Manor**, set in Lily Manor, a major hub of trade.

An ill wind blows across the village of Outer Fernbrake, which sits on the northern edge of Red Bank. An insurgency of Imperial agents made a base there, in the old ruins of Sparrow Keep. They work to undermine Red Bank from within. In service to this goal, a mage, known as the Weaver of Secrets, has murdered Castor, a local boy. The sorcerous nature of the murder points the finger at Oniri, who is newly arrived in Red Bank. Agents of the Empire fan the flames of conspiracy theories that seek to bring down Oniri, and by association, Thea. The Autarch sees Oniri as a threat to her hegemony. And indeed, this task is succeeding. The people are turning against the leadership of Red Bank.

At the same time, envoys from Red Bank have arrived at Lily Manor for the annual Sunfall Trade. This is a major festival that draws in representatives from major factions throughout the lands of Six Winters. Despite the unrest in Red Bank, it would be folly to miss the opportunity to unite the factions in common cause against the Empire. But The Empire's influence is expanding at an alarming speed, taking both land and trade. The Empire also sent representatives to Lily Manor, working to undermine Red Bank's credibility.

## Interactions

The Empire has placed a veil ward to funnel malevolent energy into Red Bank. Conspiracies spread faster with a stronger Veil Ward. Weakening this ward also makes it easier to identify the Weaver of Secrets. If the Weaver of Secrets is brought down while the Subtect is in play, the Subtect becomes easier to take out. This is tricky to juggle, as both need to be in play at the same time.

Viator functions as somewhat of a wild card. Helping heal discord, but also making some issues more difficult. Zarrah is more difficult the more issues are in play. Finally, taking out the Sapphire Djinn can weaken the veil ward.

* Weaver of Secrets (LOCKED): Comes into play with the Weaver achievement. Weakened by weakening the veil ward. If taken out when the Subtect is in play, the Subtect can be weakened.

* Conspiracy Spreads: Fueled by the veil ward.
* Angry Locals: Fueled by conspiracies.

* The Subtect (LOCKED): Comes into play with the Subtect achievement. Can be weakened by stopping the Weaver.

* Zarrah (LOCKED): Comes into play with the Zarrah achievement.
* High Society (LOCKED): Comes into play with the Zarrah achievement.

* Global Stability: The difficulty of taking this out depends on how many conspiracies are in play in Red Bank.

* Sapphire Djinn: Can hurt the veil ward.
* Viator: A wildcard. Helps with discord - hurts with issues.

# Resolution

Based on the number of achievements of each type, a variety of results could happen. Possible negative results could include locations or effects that must be put into play, similar to spotlight locations. Or they could create more threats of a severe nature. That's nice, because it's already in the system. Additionally, could have tags placed onto Red Bank.

Positive results could grant access to new spotlight locations or special character cards.
