Some of this doc should eventually be broken out into the rules sections. Right now it focuses on how the key systems interact as well as currency flows.

# Tests

Tests and other dice manipulations are a pretty big part of the game. Trying to strike a balance between using dice, but also having ways of controlling the uncertainty. Otherwise you can get some pretty big swings.

Following is a rough schema that describes how tests are organized.

* Required / Optional (default)
   * Not sure if required tests are a very good idea, probably not, but going to keep it as a possibility for now
   * Required tests might be useful on certain locations to make them less appealing
* Solo / Lowest / Red Bank / Group (default)
   * Solo means any character the player controls, or any character at the location, but only one can make the test per turn!
      * Solo should also probably be used sparingly
   * Lowest means the character with the lowest value of a skill
      * These are probably going to come in mainly from encounter cards
   * Red Bank tests use a red bank society track, so no mana may be used (no backlash)
      * Could also use alliance tracks for tests?
* Ongoing / One-time (default)
   * Ongoing will most likely have progress tracks on the card
   * In an ongoing test, the character just adds progress based on a skill or track

# The Progress Deck

The Progress Deck contains the following elements.

* Triggers (24)
   * Timers (6)
   * Draw Asset Card
* Shuffle Card (1)

The main purpose of the progress deck is to bring the mission to a close (timers), as well as trigger location and opponent abilities.

## Questions

* Do you need a timers broken out at all?
   * Or is it better to just put symbols on those cards and let the mission card decide what it all means?
   * For now, mixing the timers in seems better
* What's on the mission cards?
   * Symbols?
      * Seasons (winter, summer, spring, fall), Magic, Environment, Base Attack, Severe Attack, Timers
      * The advantage to symbols is that the whole thing could be decoupled
   * Instructions to draw from a deck (location or encounter)?

Another option might be a unified progress deck?

# Card Types

There are five different types of cards in the game. Each type of card has slightly different ways it is put into play and used.

* Hand - Cards that are held in a player's hand, they can usually be played as interrupts, whenever the player wants
   * Sometimes there are restrictions on when they can be played, for example, only on a character at a wilderness location, etc.
* Location - These are places that characters can be, they typically have actions on them that characters can do
   * Spotlight locations are places the player's have found that they put into play at the start of a mission
* Attachment - Cards that attach to a location or a character and affect it somehow
   * Conditions, environments, challenges
* Event - These cards do something and then are usually discarded
* Obstacle - These cards go into the obstacle area for the given mission and might be triggered by progress cards

## Tags

Tags might appear on cards to give them more flavor and pair with character abilities. Cards don't have to have tags.

Common tags: Wilderness, Urban, Red Bank, Sorcery, Guard, Undead, Beast, Diplomat, Trap, Challenge, Environment, Condition, Asset, Resource, Secret, Favor

## Triggers

Cards may also have triggers that restrict how they are played.

Example triggers: Season End, Burn, On Entering Play, Lowest, Solo, Group, Completion

## Card Decks

Finally, the different types of cards get placed into different decks depending on how they're used.

* Progress - Each player uses a progress deck that triggers locations and obstacles
* Developments - These cards are available for purchase during the game, later they are placed in the progress deck at the start of the mission
* Mission - There are mission decks for the current mission that feature locations and various cards that may be retrieved as specified on the mission
* Encounter - The encounter deck for the mission has random events characters encounter via progress deck triggers
* Lifepath - Character lifepath cards are placed into the progress deck at the start of the mission
* Discord - Character discord cards are placed into the progress deck at the start of the mission

# Missions

A mission pack is split into three parts.

* Mission Overview Card
   * Mission Name
   * Mission Type
   * Difficulty
   * Relevant Skills
   * Flavor Text
   * Assets Available
   * Permanent Triggers
   * Timers
   * Achievements
   * Effects in Play
   * Art
* Mission Cards
   * The missions deck has cards in a specific ordering
   * They may be subdivided into a few different decks based on shorter goals
   * Some mission cards may are marked S for cards starting in play
      * Usually these are locations
* Encounters (usually 12 or so)
   * Types: Hand, Attachment, Event, Location, Artifact
   * Tags: Wilderness, Magic, Lair, Urban, Social, Dweomer, Foe, Guard, Obstacle, Environment, Asset, Resource, Secret, Favor
   * Triggers: "Completion", "On Entering Play", "Season End", "Return To Red Bank", "Lowest", "Solo", "Group"

## Questions

* How should the mission deck be structured?

* Can you fail missions?
  * No. (Current Choice)
     * It's not so fun to re-do a mission, particularly if you were close to finishing it the first time.
     * It's also more overhead to track progress.
     * Rather than fail, there would be "achievements" of some sort that would provide partial successes.

* Should a location be in play at all times?
   * Having one is probably easiest, so you can do "at this location" sort of effects. (Current Choice)
   * It also avoids confusing situations where a location goes away or appears and you have to shuffle characters around.
   * On the downside, it might be nice to have missions with no real fixed locations, or locations that evolve and grow.

* How do you get new mission cards?
   * Could progress through them via earlier mission cards. (Current Choice)
   * Could draw them based off of a symbol.
   * Could be part of a trigger from another card.
      * For example, an encounter card could unlock something from the mission deck.

* How do you get new encounters?
   * Could draw them based off of a symbol. (Current Choise)
   * Could be part of a trigger from another card.

# Threats

Two threats are drawn at the beginning of each season. They are typically an effect which is present through the whole season (unless resolved somehow) or an effect which triggers at season's end. The latter is the more common type of threat.

Threats tend to attach to a specific type of location, sometimes the threat will require the players to use a type of location if they have one. Sometimes a threat will take a location slot from those available.

# Analysis

Games are a combination of choices and uncertainty. If either element is lacking, it's not very interesting. Particularly without uncertainty. Identifying how choices and uncertainty mix is useful for figuring out where the game might be lacking. Also might be worth thinking about similar games and how they handle the same problems. Is it possible to think about using elements from similar games?

## Sources of Uncertainty

* Resource Dice
* Dice for Tests
* Progress Deck
   * Triggers
   * Developments
   * Lifepath Cards
   * Discord Cards
* Encounter Cards

## Key Choices

* Deck Building
* Location Uses
* Team Building
* Spending Resources
* Accumulating Conditions
* Mission Order

The Arkham Card Game and Warhammer Quest Card Game are both similar to 6W in that they're linked narratives without a spatial map of any sort, relying more heavily on card play to account for interesting tactical choices.
