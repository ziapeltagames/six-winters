# Skill Tests

The test phase could be tricky to figure out. Will need to think about the following sorts of options. By default, tests are required, and may be performed by any number of characters at the location. If the test is via an event, multiple characters may only join in on the test if they're at the same location. That is, a group is only those characters together at the same location.

* Required / Optional (default)
   * Maybe tests should default to optional, with required being a modifier used sparingly
   * If there are two required tests in conflict, the player can choose how to resolve them
   * There is a strong possibility
* Solo / Lowest / Red Bank / Group (default)
   * Solo means any character the player controls, or any character at the location, but only one can make the test per turn!
   * Lowest means the character with the lowest value of a skill
   * Red Bank tests use a red bank society track, so no mana may be used (no backlash)
* Ongoing / One-time (default)
   * Ongoing will most likely have progress tracks on the card

# The Progress Deck

The Progress Deck contains the following elements.

* Character Cards (1-N)
* Developments (1-N)
* Triggers (24)
   * Timers (6)
* Shuffle Card (1)

## Questions

* Do you need a timers broken out at all?
   * Or is it better to just put symbols on those cards and let the mission card decide what it all means?
* What's on the mission cards?
   * Symbols?
      * Seasons (winter, summer, spring, fall), Magic, Environment, Base Attack, Severe Attack, Timers
      * The advantage to symbols is that the whole thing could be decoupled
   * Instructions to draw from a deck (location or encounter)?

## Questions

* Should a location be in play at all times?
   * This is probably easiest, so you can do "at this location" sort of effects. (Current Choice)
   * It also avoids confusing situations where a location goes away or appears and you have to shuffle characters around.
   * On the downside, it might be nice to have missions with no real fixed locations, or locations that evolve and grow.
* How do you get new mission cards?
   * Could progress through them via earlier mission cards. (Current Choice)
   * Could draw them based off of a symbol.
   * Could be part of a trigger from another card.
      * For example, an encounter card could unlock something from the mission deck.
* How do you get new encounters?
   * Could draw them based off of a symbol. (Current Choise)
   * Could be part of a trigger from another card.

# Threats

Two threats are drawn at the beginning of each season. They are typically an effect which is present through the whole season (unless resolved somehow) or an effect which triggers at season's end. The latter is the more common type of threat.

Threats tend to attach to a specific type of location, sometimes the threat will require the players to use a type of location if they have one. Sometimes a threat will take a location slot from those available.
