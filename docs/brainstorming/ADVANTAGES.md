This document illustrates the different types of benefits players can gain in _Six Winters_, along with how those benefits map to encounter cards, lifepath cards, developments, locations, mission paths, and artifacts.

# Broad Types of Advantages

This list details a variety of common sorts of advantages that are mechanically supported in _Six Winters_.

These advantages are *roughly* in order of how good they are. Gaining Fortune is a very common benefit. Fortune fuels other abilities, and there isn't an easy way to get it.

Advantages that are more transient, such as bonuses to a certain kind of test, are naturally not as useful as permanent changes, such as improving a character's skill. The most powerful sorts of advantages, such as lowering apotheosis, should be tremendously rare, since that's the main timer that helps push the game forward.

* Fortune Dice
* Extra Test Dice
* Test Rerolls
* Automatic Successes
* Extra Progress on Tasks
* Resource Dice
* Resource Dice Rerolls
* Better Defense
* Extra Movement
* Moving Obstacles
* Lower Hindrance
* Moving Threats
* Removing Discord
* Removing Conditions
* Cheaper Development Costs
* Improving Resolve
* Improving Skills
* Adding Progress Remotely (Not At Location)
* Burning Threats
* Resource Track Increase
* Disposition Track Increase
* Removing Timers
* Secrets
* Lowering Apotheosis

There are other types of advantages which are very situational.

* Draw Threat Card(s)
* Draw Asset Card(s)

## Test and Task Manipulation

Tests and tasks are the two primary ways players interface with the game. It is natural that many of the benefits will apply to these two core mechanics.

There are many ways to make skill tests easier. Certain dice rolls may count as extra successes, for example each '6' could count as two successes. Or '4' could count as a success, instead of the normal '5' and '6'.

The duration of effects also impacts their usefulness. For example, a card may give a one time bonus to a test. The is not as usefully as something that stays in play for the whole season. Finally, the most useful would be a spotlight location or artifact which can be played at the start of a mission.

## Using Tags

One way to make advantages less useful is by restricting their use to the presence of certain tags. For example, a development might give a bonus to defense for any obstacle with an Undead tag. Using tags provides a way to inject more theme into the game, and it gives players interesting choices, since some characters may be better suited to different sorts of situations. The TAGS.md document gives more info on common tags that can be used with cards.

## Play Costs

Another way to make advantages less useful is to use play costs. For example, a card may cost a certain number of resources (either number of dice or value of dice) to put into play, or the players may have to take Discord or a condition. This is a very useful pattern for the game. Play costs help move the economies of the game around.

## Removing Conditions and Discord

These abilities should be used with care. Taking Conditions and getting Discord are a big source of tension, so it shouldn't be easy to lower them. It's better to have abilities that help lower the hindrance value of obstacles or that improve defense. Once you get Discord or Conditions, they should be hard to remove.

# Advantages and Card Types

This provides design guidance on how these different sorts of advantages generally are found in the various types of cards. It's okay if there is overlap. For example, many different types of cards may provide extra Fortune or give bonuses to tasks and tests. However, it is also nice if they are differentiated enough that they feel different.

## Encounter Cards

* Fortune

## Lifepath Cards

The general pattern gives a better bonus if you don't advance. Advancing frequently gives a bonus, but also inflicts some sort of cost as well.

* Draw More Threats

## Developments

Developments are also differentiated somewhat by type.

* Resources
* Test Boosts
* Task Boosts

## Locations

### Spotlight Locations

## Artifacts

These should be very good, at the level of the best developments or the highest lifepath cards. One big advantage with artifacts is that they start the session in play.
