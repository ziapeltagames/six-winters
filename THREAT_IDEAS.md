It would be nice if the threats weren't necessarily a guaranteed occurrence. One way that could happen is via a trigger causing a dice roll.

Like:

Rare: Roll 2d6 vs. Conquest. If it's higher, XYZ.

Or, using the system as it stands, maybe have Red Bank treat the society stats as skills.

Rare: Red Bank Test: Espionage 3. Success: Blah. Failure: Blah.

Perhaps you can't use mana on a Red Bank test (but you can use luxuries and fortune).
