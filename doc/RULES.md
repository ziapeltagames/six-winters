# Rules

Clearly the rules are in a state of constant flux. There are some core themes and design goals that I hope to hit, though:

- A legacy game, with around 13 sessions for the entire campaign.
- Each session should take no more than 2 hours.
- Playable by two players (possibly this number will be expanded to include solo or 3+).
- Primarily uses card driven mechanics.
- Mission based play.
- Players create a party of heroes for each mission, choosing who to take and leave behind.

## General Overview

The game follows the broad arc of the WotA rpg. Each season, different heroes are taken on various missions to explore, gather resources, create diplomatic relationships, go on quests, and infiltrate the Empire. A mission consists of drawing cards of various types from a deck.

# Cards

There are few different types of cards.

## General Mission Cards

There are broadly applicable cards for exploration, diplomacy, infiltration, and quests. Some number of these cards are placed in the deck.

## Specific Mission Cards
