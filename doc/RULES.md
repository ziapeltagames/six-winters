# Rules

Clearly the rules are in a state of constant flux. There are some core themes and design goals that I hope to hit, though:

- A legacy game, with around 13 sessions for the entire campaign.
- Each session should take no more than 2 hours.
- Playable by two players (possibly this number will be expanded to include solo or 3+).
- Primarily uses card driven mechanics.
- Mission based play.
- Players create a party of heroes for each mission, choosing who to take and leave behind.
