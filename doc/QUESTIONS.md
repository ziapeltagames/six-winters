# Open Design Questions

These are the big design questions that I'm grappling with.

## Spatial Game

Is there a map or larger strategic board? What would be the point?

- Track Imperial military progress?
- Build road networks?
- Track which regions are locked / unlocked?
- Track where threats are currently taking place?
- As a repository for data about regions, factions, and missions?

## Number of Players

My main goal is to have the game work both solo and with two players.

### Coordination

TBD

## Working Title

Not really sure what to call it! Not a huge fan of *Six Winters*.

- Six Winters
- Thirteen Winters (If each session is more like a year.)
- Wrath of the Autarch The Boardgame
- Apotheosis
