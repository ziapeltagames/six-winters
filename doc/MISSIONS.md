# Missions

Missions are the main unit of play. The core of missions is a push your luck system, where you dig for various sorts of assets. This document covers various design options for what each mission type provides.

# Mission Difficulties

The exact mission difficulties are going to be somewhat fluid, but there is a rough scale of 1-10 that is being used during development. At the highest end, the assumption is the players are capable of rolling the max dice, currently set at 15, along with lots of fortune and re-rolls from luxuries, not to mention mana spends, which could be 4-5. Given all that, 10 successes at the high end becomes fairly likely. So, the mission difficulty is roughly equal to the number of successes needed by a group for tests on related skills. Although, there can be some variation, since the difficulty doesn't really scale linearly.

Solo successes are roughly 1/2 of this number, and lowest successes are roughly 1/3. It doesn't scale exactly, because mana can be used to inflate the number of successes in solo tests just as much as in group tests, despite the fact fewer dice are rolled. That is, mana has an outsized impact in solo tests.

## Event Difficulties

Events are in general easier than mission cards. As earlier event cards are burned and new ones are put in their place, the overall difficulty of missions will increase. However, the difficulty will very roughly approximate the current year. So, late even cards will have a difficulty of around 6, and earlier mission cards will have a difficulty around 1.
