# Trade

Trade works as it does in WotA at the moment.

# Pools

Pools are used in various ways during the game to modify dice rolls.

## Mana Pool

Starts each session with a number of dice equal to the total of all currently available mana resources.

### Using Mana

To use mana, one character involved in the test must be nominated as the caster.

When mana are added to a roll, they are automatic successes. All mana dice must be added to the roll at the same time. They are added to the test after the roll is made. Thus, with mana, it's possible to know for certain a test will be successful. Another restriction: the number of mana dice used must be less than the caster's Lore skill.

The mana dice are rolled not to determine success or failure, but to determine backlash. Roll all the mana dice. Then, compare each mana die to all the other dice, even the other mana dice! For every matching die face, the caster checks off one condition.

Finally, the caster can ignore one point of backlash for each point of Lore.

Example: Regular test dice show 2 and a 2, while two mana dice show a 2 and a 2. That's six backlash.

## Luxury Pool

Starts each session with a number of dice equal to the total of all currently available luxury resources.

### Using Luxury

A luxury die may be spent to re-roll any dice at any time. Even resource dice!

## Fortune Pool

Starts each session with a number of dice equal to the current Stronghold stability.

### Using Fortune

Fortune just function as extra dice for tests.
