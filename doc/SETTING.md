# Setting

The setting for Six Winters is very similar to the setting for *Wrath of the Autarch*. However, besides the various factions from the role-playing game, a particular Stronghold will need to be fleshed out. Most likely will use Red Bank for this purpose.

# Red Bank

I like the idea of creating a strong trading capital, something to rival Lily Manor. It is fairly cosmopolitan. There's a little double entendre in the name. Red Bank is both a monetary hub as well as being situated on a wide, winding river.

## Wrath: Interest is Owed

There's a dark history buried in Red Bank's past. The founders of Red Bank borrowed significant funds and resources from the current Autarch's grandfather to start this new colony. Contracts were signed and agreed upon to pay these funds back. Due to a growing cultural rift, there is no political will to make these payments. So they have stopped. The Empire will not abide by that decision.

## Belief: Keepers of True Lore

The people of Red Bank feel like they hold keys to knowledge which would be lost under Imperial rule. Large libraries adorn the city proper. Protecting this hard gained knowledge is a common rallying cry within Red Bank.

## Culture: Duality of Atom and Void

There are many sects within Red Bank that value empirical inquiry. This inquiry has been codified and adopted into cultural norms that ripple outward: a rejection of determinism and the adoption of scholarly hedonism. This puts Red Bank closer ideologically to Lily Manor than the Empire.

## History: Riders of the Amber Hand

All was not always scholarship and republicanism. Prior to founding Red Bank, most of the inhabitants in the area were members of a vicious warband known as the Amber Hand. There is still an affinity toward the legacy of mounted warfare handed down from those founders. This is also part of the dark past of Red Bank: it is a city founded on violence and theft.

## Rule: Elevenfold Conclave

Different subject matter experts are elected throughout the populace to serve on a broad council which makes most of the policy decisions. The process of election varies, and is frequently plagued by corruption and graft, but many of the leaders are competent and have thus far guided Red Bank to rapid success.

## Faction Dispositions

Note: rather than have two factions starting with disposition, I'm going to have one of them start at -1. This will make things a little harder, but that's going to be necessary in general in the co-op version.

# Potential Influences

I like the idea of basing some of the cultural touchstones for Red Bank on the Byzantine Empire, nominally around 1350.
