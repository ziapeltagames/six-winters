Mobilize War Machines,2-5,"Keel wrapped his gray chlamys tightly around his body, in a feeble attempt to block out the cold rain. He crouched down on the cold stone of the wall overlooking the military ward.","Far below Keel, scattered everywhere, were components of steel, wood, and other materials not recognizable. Imperial artificers, clad in their distinctive green and gold tunics, went about the business of assembling these parts into large constructions on a grand scale.

Isolate Brightdune's Allies,2-5,"'No,' said Hogel, head bowed in shame.","'Good,' The Subtect replied. 'And that goes for your new friends as well. You'd do well remember that Brightdune is a haven for witchcraft and dark sorcery, best expunged from our holy shores. Meddling in these affairs will only curse you and all those you love.'","Hogel glanced over at his retinue, then stood up, bowed, and left the meeting tent.

Unravel the Weave of Fates,2-5,"'I know,' Oniri said, looking toward the dense trees in the moonlight. 'I can see it.'","'You can?' Yasmina said softly. 'I can feel the Autarch pulling at the wild threads in these forests, but I can't find the source. I can just sense anguish from the flora and fauna. Their fires are being extinguished.'",Yasmina closed her eyes as the swift-moving mountain stream sprayed frigid water against her face.,"'When the Weavers of the Downward Tulip recorded the fates into their carpet, they were burned for their troubles,' Yasmina said.

'Please continue to inform us of any gatherings the locals here undertake. It is so easy for enemy agents to corrupt the tranquility here, endangering the great peace and bounty the Autarch provides.'","Metrodora glanced towards a busy section of the barley trough, then fixed her gaze back on the gray-cloak, hoping nothing was given away.","'My life is in servitude and benevolent awe to the Autarch,' Metrodora said.",,xxTIMER Put an xxOBSTACLE Imperial Guard into play.

Six winters past, we began a great project, only now reaching its natural conclusion.'","The Autarch closed her eyes, feeling the faraway lands rich with life and vitality, pulling the threads of energy into the Hall.
