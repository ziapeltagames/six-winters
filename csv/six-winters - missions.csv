He shucked his armor off, leaving him in his more dexterous leathers, and hooked his crossbow onto his arm. A quick shot, and the grappling attachment reeled him up to crouch on the window sill.","He didn't get the information, but he could still make a difference. He fired an exploding bolt into the room.
