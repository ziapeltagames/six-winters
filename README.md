# six-winters
*Six Winters* is the current working title for the *Wrath of the Autarch* boardgame. It currently combines legacy kingdom building elements with a push your luck card driven quest system.

## Cards in Clojure
The clojure model simulates the mission card deck for rapid prototyping purposes. This enables various deck builds to be tested quickly without the overhead of physical cards.
