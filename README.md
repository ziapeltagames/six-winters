# six-winters

*Six Winters* is the current working title for the *Wrath of the Autarch* boardgame. It currently combines legacy kingdom building elements with a push your luck card driven quest system. Think *Incan Gold* meets *Tales of the Arabian Nights* meets *Kingsburg*.

## doc

Musings on rules, playtests, background setting, and various textual artifacts. My goal is to keep all design artifacts as markdown text for as long as possible. I've been burned by trying to make things look nice when they're changing too quickly. At some point, I'll have to create some usable cards, characters, maps, etc, but for as long as possible I'm hoping to have a really quick and dirty process.

### Playtests

TBD: Gravewood Mission 08_10_17

## src

The clojure model simulates the mission card deck for rapid prototyping purposes. This enables various deck builds to be tested quickly without the overhead of physical cards.

## resources

Contains various card decks I'm experimenting with during playtesting.
